UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's stepped up military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
The U .N . chief again urged all parties, including the divided U .N . Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U .S ., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable ."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper .
Others have dismissed him as a joke .
And some are holding out for an implosion .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet) .
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances .
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle .
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him .
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
By mid-July, it was 40 percent .
In early August, it was 52 percent .
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump .
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
And these numbers hold up in early states .
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee .
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee .
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs . 40 percent who say the same of Trump) .
The next closest in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee .
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem .
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll .
The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week .
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week .
That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July .
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs . only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney .
Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible .
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone .
Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates .
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support .
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each .
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head .
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds .
When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on .
He was crying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick .
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican .
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred .
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
It was a very bad tackle with two legs .
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger ."
Related: Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw blow in defeat at PSV
The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury ."
If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it .
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
"He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent, and when you hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said .
For me it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke .
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it, I am so sorry .
PSV's Andr√©s Guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Smalling .
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it's still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I wouldn't rule out an away win, either .
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity .
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option .
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire .
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output .
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors .
A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along .
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else .
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the chance home and away .
The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly .
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE .
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against .
I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer .
Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference .
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man .
People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke .
He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped .
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before, can freshen up a side .
Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule .
And you have to remember, like players, their jobs are dependent on results .
Such decisions are never taken lightly .
Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes, even without the election of genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too .
A European diplomat chum explained the other day that, sunk in assorted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don't want .
In Brighton for its annual bean, the TUC decided it didn't want them either if they eroded social protection .
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda .
PM and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local grandee, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
It's all about me .
My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) .
France's Fran√ßois Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017 .
He is a fading force too .
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right, Spain one of the left .
It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies .
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests .
"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation ."
The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1 .
They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist, making his name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s .
For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers .
Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them, but realised that when you're in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card .
The press never forgave him that either .
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now .
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday .
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving .
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU .
Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that .
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilary's struggle was more attractive .
But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts .
Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles .
As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits" feeble military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday .
Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes .
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence ."
But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion .
Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand ."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness ."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper .
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study .
He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said .
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added .
The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE .
The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote .
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report .
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before .
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking ."
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction .
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS ¬£2bn a year .
By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit .
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The adverts shaming Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video .
Horrific killer drones!
Ankle-shattering leg irons!
Cluster bombs!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands .

But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance .
"Important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using London Underground fonts and branding with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank .
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR  . . . Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair .
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland .
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a ¬£6 pack of Allen keys which it claims "gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet ."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism ."
One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective .
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries .
A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements, realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society .
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greeting commuters on the tube .
The Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency VCCP working pro bono, with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid ."
They toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert, but "by ramming it home with bright colours and animation, it was more arresting ."
"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty .
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products .
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US army for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS ."
This includes a "unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target ."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant .
Eight golden rules for living in student halls
It's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying .
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room ."
Take a breath .
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers .
Give people space .
People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear .
Related: Don't even think about starting university in a relationship
Introverts get a raw deal at university .
Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships .
That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you ."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking .
Speaking of knocking: do it .
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in .
He saw some things .
Make friends through baking .
Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions ."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends .
Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise .
Obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker .
Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock .
Stealing food is a common crime in student halls .
Obviously nicking someones chicken is theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing?
Double check with the milk owner .
Chances are they'll tell you to help yourself even if they're seething inside .
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate, who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it .
She's in jail now .
You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses .
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn't mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning .
They responded by turning it up .
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown .
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc .
Frequently referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public .
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town .
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop, offering an dizzying array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations .
There's even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil .
The store is massive, and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles .
If all that shopping makes you hungry, grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express .
The store's indoor food stall (good, inexpensive) is near the registers, and has various takeout options .
What it stocks: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it .
Items are reasonably priced, and a number of items are sold in bulk .
Fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more .
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish, and even fry it for you if you'd like .
A good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork casings, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially-prepared foods and more .
Who shops there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals .
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts .
The find: Fresh monthong durian next to the checkout stand .
Where is it: The store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles hugging the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
Parking: LAX-C has its own lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants .
While the store can get busy, parking is usually not hard to find .
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's dash to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today .
Nine's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's overthrow of Tony Abbott .
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international telecasts which also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun .
That tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today's 339,000 .
Today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but its figure was behind last Thursday's (343,000) .
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months .
In August, Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise's 330,000 .
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000 .
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning .
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

It could have been very lethal for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach .
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths .
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient .
Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient .
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room .
Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district .

Dons stretch lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to open up a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
It has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders .
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it .
Lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there's no title rivalry with Rangers .
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why?"
It is because Rangers aren't there .
People here don't only talk about Rangers coming back .
They talk about the Old Firm .
They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in .
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I'll turn things around, vows Deila
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around .
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-man Aberdeen, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table .
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again ."
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible .
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening .
That is the same as we are - but we have to go on .
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better .

Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity .
The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window ."
In terms of players coming in the summer, you have that pre-season period to bed them in, which you've seen with our own group this season .
The squad is doing really well .
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target Michu in retirement hint
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Swans is up .

Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death .
If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed .
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it .
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we talk .
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality .
Here's the lesson .
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing .
Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written .
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did .
I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it .
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement .
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me .
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made .
I won't go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact .
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .
Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately .
He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain .
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes ."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said .
They know it went on .
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer .
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence .
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing .com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing .com .
They obviously believe I'm a cheat .
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me .
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
Should that make me think it's becoming personal?
Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am .
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that .
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me .
That really saddens me .
I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision .
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away .
The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table ."
Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules .
It's against the rules of racing .
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said .
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg .
It could have had it last night .
It could have had it yesterday, which it did have .
It had it on race day .
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into .
It is a joke .
People making these rules know nothing about the horse .
"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said .

The qualifiers are not enough .
Hats off to Paris .
It was a magnificent match from them .
Glencore raises $2 .5 billion in share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodities prices, on Wednesday raised $2 .5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-slashing plan .
London-listed Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about ¬£1 .6 billion to pay down debt .
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets .
The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .
Shares jumped 2 .77 percent to 131 .60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0 .69 percent higher .
Glencore had last week revealed the $2 .5-billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $30 billion debt pile by about a third .
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2 .4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday .
It offloaded 1 .3 billion shares worth up to 9 .99 percent of the group .
Concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half, as coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .

A football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali: The decision he has taken
A football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali in terms of promoting young players .
After the champion's financer decided to close the Football Academy in which he has invested a considerable amount, defender Paul Papp opened a Football School .
"Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the city of Dej, and the city's children are expected for a first selection .
I am extremely happy to have reached this stage, to kick off the Football Academy which bears my name .
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children, who can play football without worrying about the future during training .
They must have only one thought: to play football as good as possible .
The technical details do not have to be in their care .
They must capitalise their talent .
This is what "Paul Papp" Football Academy aims to do .
"I expect mayor Costan Morar to be at the children's first selection, to prove to them that he supports them," said footballer Papp for dejeanul .ro .
Steaua defender's Academy is waiting for children under the age of 11 .
All party members have decided to remain in power .
On Tuesday, the interim president of PSD (Social Democratic Party) Liviu Dragnea said that all party members decided to remain in power, and if the prime minister agrees, this decision will be formalized during the PSD Congress .
I understand that Mr Ponta expect this decision from the PSD congress, all members want to remain in power, the whole party .
If he wants this decision to be formalized by a decision of the Congress, we will do it .
There is no doubt about it .
"There are no developments, voices, opinions within the party to give the uncertainty of wanting to be part of the government or give the impression that anyone in the party does not want PSD to remain in power, in the current government, with the current prime minister", said Dragnea at the end of the PSD National Standing Bureau meeting .
PSD announced it will organise a Congress - and that this issue will be decided then
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that beside electing its leadership, during the PSD Congress the members of the party should decide if the party will be part of the current government or join the opposition .
Dragnea: On Monday I will announce if I am going to run for congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position during the next Congress or not .
On Monday, after the Executive Committee, I will weigh the decision if the congress date is set .
"I will announce whether I will run for the party leadership or not" said Dragnea at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD National Standing Bureau .
Asked if his hesitancy regarding the announcement of his candidacy has anything to do with his criminal file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem .
I do not have the problem you are referring to, but it seems right and fair to all my colleagues in the party to announce my candidacy at the time of the establishment of the congress date .
"It's my only motivation", said Dragnea .
Most social democratic branches proposed the date of October 11 for the extraordinary congress, and the exact date will be decided on Monday by the Executive Committee of the party .

An Italian was caught at Bors customs with immigrants hidden in his truck
Two citizens of Sri Lanka were found on Monday at Bors customs while trying to illegally cross the border, hidden in the trailer of a truck driven by an Italian citizen .
The investigations determined that the two had paid the driver with 4,000 euros to be transported to France, informs the Border Police .
During the routine control, the border policemen observed in the truck's cab, a large travel bag, which contained personal things of many people, which is why they conducted a thorough check on the means of transport .
With this occasion, the border policemen found two males hidden in the truck's trailer among plastic crates .
The verifications established that the two men, aged 28 years old, are citizens of Sri Lanka and have requested asylum in Romania .
"During the investigations, the two young men said they wanted to reach France, which is why they made contact with a countryman, through which they met with the Italian driver . The latter has offered to carry them to their destination, where he would receive 2,000 euros per person", according to the Border Police press release .
The police drew up for the two migrants a "criminal file under the accusation of attempted illegal crossing of the state border" .

How satisfied are the Romanian couples: men versus women
Most Romanians are satisfied with their relationships .
This is the conclusion of a study conducted in Romania with the coming of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" .
A total of 62% of respondents say they are "very satisfied" and "satisfied" with the overall quality of their couple's relationship .
"However, 18% seem to be "slightly dissatisfied" and "very dissatisfied" in their couple life and another 18% "moderate" is the conclusion of the study, as stated in a press release issued on Tuesday to Ziare .com .
The situation is slightly different when responses are analysed separately for men and women .
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% moderate, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly dissatisfied .
Regarding women, 33% are satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose moderate .

Thousands of people lit a candle in his memory
Thousands of people came to see the coffin with the body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor . Sfantul George Church had not seen so many people since the consecration of the church or the Great Celebration of St . Nicholas, said pastor Emil Caramizaru on Wednesday .
Hundreds of people of all ages wait in a line which stretches from the church entrance to the side streets, to reach the bier with the coffin containing the body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor .
People wait about an hour to reach the Sfantul Gheorghe Nou Church, where groups of 40 people are allowed in .
On Wednesday, approximately 300 people per hour came to pay their respects to Corneliu Vadim Tudor .
Starting Tuesday, thousands of people in Bucharest but also Cluj, Baia Mare, Iasi, Constanta and Craiova came to bring homage to Corneliu Vadim Tudor . The church has never had so many visitor since its 300 year consecration and since the Great Feast of St . Nicholas .
"Corneliu Vadim Tudor was present at the 300 year consecration of the church and stayed beside the members of the Holy Synod, Patriarch Daniel and the representatives of the five patriarchates who attended the consecration", said the parish priest of the church in the capital, Emil Caramizaru .
According to him, people came with flowers and candles, sat quietly and waited in line, as they would have done for a great religious holiday .
The behaviour of these people is extraordinary . Children, old people, people in crutches sat quietly, with dignity, as they would have done for a great religious holiday .

What happens with coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, as she is being forced to choose whether to continue or not to collaborate with coach Darren Cahill .
The two have worked together this year in the Adidas Player Development Programme, the Australian coach staying with the Romanian tennis player only during majour tournaments .
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to assert himself in front of the whimsical tennis player .
However, the Adidas program will end at the end of this year and Halep must decide whether she provides Cahill with a consistent contract or if she quits working with him .
We do not know yet exactly what will happen .
We will talk and see .
"After Singapore I will be able to provide an answer" confessed Simona at a press conference .
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today and he is asking for a contract of a million dollars a year .
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he wouldn't want to quit now .
The last competition during which Simona and Cahill will work together is the Champions Tournament from Singapore .
It was not normal, I was not respected
Victor Piturca has revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team in the fall of last year .
The former coach said she did not get along with FRF president, Razvan Burleanu who replaced Mircea Sandu, and so he decided to leave the national team .
Finally, the head of the Federation was asked to substantial increase his salary to make him stay, but he refused .
Right now I'm not sorry that I left the national team .
I was sorry then, because I was leaving my work behind .
I thought that what I was doing at the time was good for me and I think it was indeed good for me .
What happened to me when I was coach was not normal, I was not respected, people did not respect my work .
I worked well with those who used to be in the Federation before, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he had preconceived ideas about me although he did not know me . He used to make his opinion about me from the news .
I was not replaced because it was very difficult at that time, considering the results I had, plus the financial situation was taken into account .
I continued working, everything went very well and perhaps he changed his opinions .
But I wanted to leave .
If he really wanted me to stay, I proposed an extension of the contract .
My salary was about 400 something thousand Euros per year and I was going to receive around 600 thousand Euros .
I did not talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand .
"He agreed, but only if the team managed to finish in the first place of the group", said Victor Piturca for Dolce Sport .
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team perform well in the Euro 2016 qualifiers .
The coach has accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, immediately joining team Al Ittihad .
Armour-clad vehicles and water cannons at the border
The calculations stated that the votes existed .
But they did not want to go forward .
Because it's a sensitive issue, even Germany rejected Chancellor Merkel's policy of openness and did not want other countries to see it as: "EU thrusts migrants upon us" .
The matter was therefore postponed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governance and we will likely see big changes in the next period .
Mandatory quotas were not really removed, but was the subject only allowed to further cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, tongues are wagging about greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a shift of responsibility from the individual member countries found near Schengen's outer border to the Community agencies .
Greece's border with Turkey is actually Germany's border with Turkey, and this wave of migrants proved to be the limit for the old Schengen system .
Maybe the Dublin principle will be dropped because it is not sustainable . This principle states that migrants are the responsibility of the State in which they have entered first .
If Greece overturns, you cannot indefinitely sustain it's Greece's deal .
This is a common problem .
Precisely because this is a common problem, is it possible to fix it without a precise mechanism, perhaps even a shared mandatory effort to receive the migrants?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if it comes to this .
A question still remains unanswered: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but instead wants to go to Sweden or Germany?
I do not think the European states will rush at the migrants: you will go to country X or country Y .
Perhaps it will come to the creation of some unique filtration centres in Greece or in Turkey where the refuge applications will be processed .
These kind of solutions are being conceived .
But the problem does not have a simple solution .
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries with no experience as is the case of Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase xenophobic trends .
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, living in precarious camps and who are just beginning to head towards Europe .
One estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave because it is hard cross the Mediterranean during winter, but next year we expect an even bigger migration wave .
What about these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem and it will not seem so catastrophic in terms of media coverage .
You were talking about more or less experienced countries .
Does it seem like there are some places that have really managed to integrate large groups coming from a non-European culture?
I see the Maghrebians in France, Turks in Germany, they are also landlocked .
I would not make radical statements .
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that does not mean they are not integrated at all .
There are still some who remain unintegrated, creating majour social problems in France, Germany, UK .
But pure policing means will not work .
To create a fortress out of Europe is an illusory concept .
We have to develop the mechanisms of integration in European societies .
Some mistakes have been made in this area .
We must be more demanding .
For me it's a priority to bring majour handball competitions in Romania .
Mr . Gatu went with a project in a civilized manner and many have agreed in principle with it but they soon learned that the hall will never be built .
I have also had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we are willing, that we are able to organize such a competition and they said that they agree and that we should invite them to the first match in the new Bucharest hall so we can discuss in concrete terms afterwards .
"So EHF and IHF are both open to the idea, but we have no infrastructure" the RHF official explained .
The great former handball player avoided to evaluate the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucuresti and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in making forecasts, because if they do not happen, it will prejudice them ."
A safe journey to the World Cup
Romanian Rugby players have their debut on September 23 against France
The national rugby team's captain, Mihai Macovei said, on Tuesday, during a press conference, that all the members of the Romanian team are prepared for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to obtain two victories: "We are ready" .
Both my colleagues and I have our engines at full speed .
We have trained to give our best during the four matches .
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win two matches against Canada and Italy .

The coach of the national team of Romania, Lynn Howells, who is at his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the national rugby team: "It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup ."
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament .
For me, it's a great experience .
For me it is very important to make the Romanians proud of the national team during each match .

We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made by the national team .
I wish the players good luck and I believe will do our best at the event .

14 million lei given to "Sf . Spiridon" Hospital at the budget adjustment
What will this amount of money be used for?
"Sf . Spiridon" Hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget adjustment, about 14 million lei .
The money received by the medical unit to be used until the end of the year will be invested in modernization and planning works of some clinics, but also for equipment and medical technology for which the hospital has already initiated the procurement procedure .
The health unit will thus be equipped with a new Tomography Computer, a new X-ray device, six surgery kits, six ICU beds properly equipped, an ophthalmologic microscope and other equipment necessary to conduct the medical activity .
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and planning of "Marele Ars" (The Great Burnt) .
From the money coming from the budget adjustment, the ER will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section .
"In addition, in the coming days we will accept the works from the bridge linking the ER to the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the proper transfer of patients from the ER to the neighbouring clinics" explained the manager of the medical unit .
The Hospital will soon have the TƒÉtƒÉra»ôi Dermatology Clinic in its premises, which will be managed in ambulatory, in the form as it currently operates .
The clinic will operate in the area where the ambulatory allergy, haematology and endocrinology sections are and will have around 30 beds .
Iasi, embarrassed by the Autonomous Administration of Public Transport controllers and a leaflet .
The adventure of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to visit Iasi, but the trip ended with a bitter promise .
After this experience, my wife and I never want to set foot in your city .
Unwillingly, they faced false information from leaflets, the rudeness of the controllers of the Autonomous Administration of Public Transport (RATP) and a fine as a bonus "because the law says so ."
The couple arrived in Iasi a few days ago, they checked into a hotel and asked for tourist leaflets .
They also received a leaflet with the RATP routes .
"Armed" with these maps, the spouses visited Iasi .
But two days ago, while they were in Copou, they wanted to go to Palas Mall .
Since there was not a ticket booth in the station near Copou park, they relied on the information printed on the leaflet: they can buy a ticket by SMS .
No one told them that this service no longer exists .
Confident in the leaflet, they boarded the bus and tried to send a SMS following the instructions on the leaflet .
Unfortunately for them, a RATP control team showed up .
They said the service no longer exists for 2 years and that the press announced it has been cancelled .
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW what was written in the local press, since I came to visit the city a night ago?
I spoke with the controllers, we explained the situation and they said they do not care, it's not their job .
The attitude was very defiant .
They said all they can do is give us just one fine instead of two (for my wife and myself) .
"I paid, I did not want to ruin my site seeing day at the gendarmerie giving statements!" says Ovidiu .
In conclusion, the family was fined due to the erroneous information from the leaflet and the controllers "who applied the law to the letter ."
This is not right, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to recover my money .
It's not about the money, the amount was not that great, but the fact is that I felt cheated on .
Bad luck for the rapists of Vaslui .
They had an accident and remained in custody
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui was transferred, yesterday, to the Court of Appeal Ia»ôi .
The Magistrates of Iasi county settled the first hearing in a closed session in which the seven youths were accused of raping a young woman aged 18, requested to be set free .
Before starting the actual hearing, one of the judges from Iasi county who had been assigned the case, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was accepted by his colleagues .
The magistrate worked until this summer at Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Criminal Section, and he is the one who, on April 9 admitted an appeal brought by four of the defendants, ordering their placement under house arrest .
Currently, the case is judged by a panel that includes the magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu .
Judge Dan Anton also made a request for abstention earlier in the case, because his daughter is in a relationship of cohabitation with one of the rapists' lawyers  .
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui should remain in custody .
The young men will remain imprisoned for at least 30 days, period after which the judges will re-discuss the possibility of setting them free .
The next hearing will be held at the Court of Appeal of Iasi county on October 6 .
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal of Iasi, the van transporting the rapists from Vaslui was involved in an accident in PƒÉcurari district as the car was entering Iasi city through the beltway .
The Iveco van that transported the seven rapists was hit by a Volkswagen that came from Canta Street whose driver tried to turn left .
The van was coming from the end of PƒÉcurari .
The car came this way because the Prison Administration employees preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi which passed the location of Grajduri and then they entered on the beltway .
In this way, the road was shortened by a few kilometres .
Immediately after the impact, the prisoners' escort called for another transport to take the prisoners .
Soon, at the accident scene, arrived a car sent from the Iasi Maximum Security Penitentiary, which took the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal .
Following the accident, none of the prisoners was injured .
To transfer them into the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars and the prisoners came out fast by twos .
"The incident was not reported to the Police because the drivers of the two cars have amicably agreed on the damages to be paid," stated Chief Commissioner MƒÉdƒÉlin »öƒÉranu of the County Police Inspectorate .
The great migrations
Romania is not nor will it be ever be ready for what comes next .
What about Europe?
I'm going to say this from the beginning, loud and clear: the approximate 7,000 refugees who should be and have to be naturalised by Romania is in itself an insignificant number, but a huge one compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage this kind of project  .
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1,500 souls, surpasses by far our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months .
Certainly, if those migrants will accept to settle in our cities, the chances of a quick integration in the Romanian society are extraordinarily small .
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience .
Sucked dry by the parasites of the underworld gangs and by a venal political class, the Romanian State proves to be impotent in all areas .
Failure to integrate the Gypsies is just a trivial example .
Besides, governments of any colour were not able to absorb European funds to build roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent health care, collect the garbage of the streets, create decently paid jobs or prevent its young generation from leaving the country .
Why would a refugee settle in a country similar to the one he's running away from?
But what is particularly surprising is the hypocrisy displayed when dealing with such a crisis .
Firstly, we come into contact with the hypocrisy of the bellicose powerful countries of the EU, which are especially generous when it comes to sharing their troubles with smaller countries .
The second thing is the Romanians' hypocritical fear . Although Romanians have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, they still do not accept the person next to them - the one speaking a different language, having a different religion or just because he has different blood running through his veins .
We are probably afraid that someone will steal our national identity .
In the end, there is the hypocrisy of many migrants who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, do not accept another destination of their exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries .
However, not all refugees are Syrian, and Pakistan is not at war .
Furthermore, the simple way of analysing the crisis can only be derided .
Some argue that the causes must be eliminated strictly relying on political correctness, asking for peace and investments in the migrants' home countries .
But Romania is at peace and occasionally, some foreign capital is injected in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving the country every year .
Why do they leave?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed to be a stiff, divided and overwhelmed structure .
We express criticism about the fact that Romania is not able to invent a project for the country, but we see that the EU also doesn't have any plans for the future .
Improvisations and threats will not help .
Considering the above, what is the use of the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by the Romanians - freedom of movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing borders with no effort whatsoever?
At one point, the war in Syria will end .
The migrant crisis will not .
In the following decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc . will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa to a better life .
With such politicians, Romania is not nor will it be ever be ready for what comes next .

EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that will break your heart .
At the age 20 she received a brave gift: her biological parents
Lost in the hospital under unclear circumstances in the mist of the 90s, when she was only two months old, tiny ill and helpless, she was adopted by a wealthy family form Italy . During this time, the adoption laws in Romania were loosely regulated . The young girl from Ia»ôi who is now a beautiful blonde girl, was reunited with their biological parents in a village of the county after nearly two decades in which neither her or her biological parents new nothing about one another .
Crina will turn 20 a few days from now, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter a courageous and staggering gift: a visit to Romania, to Ia»ôi, to learn about her unclear past .
"Ziarul de Iasi" assisted in the efforts to find a family based on a few extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings which basically broke our hearts .
The story of the reporters, the emotions, the statements of those involved and their reactions are downright poignant and overwhelming .
Crina's story begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa of Ia»ôi county, when she was only two months old .
Due to health problems, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city .
At home, disagreements between the parents started to arise and the mother had to leave the residence .
The father decided to keep the girl and to drive me away from home .
He kept the girl, and after that I lost all contact .
"When I found out that she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina grieving, the biological mother of the girl .
Crina and her grandmother were admitted to the hospital of the municipality of Pa»ôcani, and on the same day her father, Costica Balcan went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County .
Their lives would forever part ways .
They did not find Crina at the hospital .
After admission, Crina's father went to work in another town and returned after six months .
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Ia»ôi and when the father came back he couldn't find her .
I think almost nine months had passed since the girl was hospitalized .
"Maybe she thought she was been abandoned", says a niece of the family .
Because of financial problems, the grandmother could not go with Crina to Ia»ôi and the girl remained in the care of the doctors .
Because during all this time nobody came to ask about the fate of the child, she was taken by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection in Ia»ôi, who then gave her to the Foster Care Centre in Bucium .
During that period, abandonment and adoption were more lightly regulated in comparison to today's regulations in Romania .
The child was found in the centre in Bucium by an Italian, Salvatore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their own child but could not .
They fell in love with blonde Crina, and after some time she moved to Italy with them .
The little girl had turned almost two when the adoption formalities were completed .
When I saw Crina, I felt she's our girl .
"It was like my wife had given birth to her", says Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiling, while his hand caches the girl's frail hand .
At home, Crina's parents, Alina and CosticƒÉ continued to search separately, wherever they were able to .
The father questioned the authorities of Ruginoasa, but received no reply about the whereabouts of his child .
The police then informed him that she may be deceased, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter in Ia»ôi .
When I sought her here, the Court told me that she is in Italy, Palermo .
I couldn't look for her anymore .
We prayed to God to keep her safe .
I thought of her all the years, but we did not have the possibility to find her .
"It's hard," says the biological mother of Crina with tears in her eyes .
However, even if the years passed, the parents from Ruginoasa were never forgotten .
In Italy, Salvatore and his wife explained to the girl about her origins and that her past links her to Romania .
I was just a little girl when I found out .
I think I was five or six .
I reacted just like a child, I was curious .
"I wanted to meet my parents from Romania," says Crina delighted .
Her dream was going to come true .
This March, Chief Commissioner RomicƒÉ Ichim, the Regional Director of the Centre for Prevention, Assessment and Counselling in Ia»ôi, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find Crina's biological family .
The search began with just a name .
After the request from our partners in Italy, we began taking the first steps .
I only received a name, Balcan Costica, then the name of the town, Ruginoasa .
Shortly after that I conducted a business with the city hall of Ruginoasa, and I had the possibility to ask whether the name I received was familiar to the locals .
Then they gave me some pointers, only to find that the person I was directed to wasn't he person I was looking for .
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father," explains Chief Commissioner RomicƒÉ Ichim .
In total, the authorities needed more than three months to find CosticƒÉ and Alina, especially since each of them was domiciled in another locality .
We started work somewhere in March and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and concluded the discussions .
"Then we decided that the first meeting will take place in September", added RomicƒÉ Ichim .
Last weekend, Alina and CosticƒÉ saw the girl who was lost on the halls of the hospital in Iasi for the first time in 20 years .
The father was excited and barely able to control his tears and his hands were shaking incessantly .
He barely exchanged a few words with the people around him .
A week before the meeting he hadn't really been able to sleep .
He was all excited, shaking .
"It's something extraordinary to see your baby after so many years", says a niece who came with CosticƒÉ from Ruginoasa .
Meeting between Crina and her biological mother and brother
While talking to his daughter, who is going to study at a top universities in Italy, Costica Balcan said, among other things, that if his daughter ever wanted to return to him in the village, she could come at any time: he can give her some sheep, goats, she can find a man from the village and start a household .
Her mother is also emotional, cries, and she can hardly believe such a thing could happen to her .
I'm very nervous .
I could not believe something like this could happen .
I've seen such cases only on TV, I kept thinking about her all these years, I hoped, but I never thought it could happen to me .
I am very nervous .
If she could only forgive me .
I hope that we can visit each other in the future .
"I hope we can stay in contact", says Alina with big tears on her cheeks, Crina's mother, while holding a napkin tight in her hand .
She hides her tears of happiness in that napkin, because soon she will see her daughter after so long .
On the other side, Crina, whose birthday is in just a few days from now, is turning 20 and she's trying to calm herself just like an emotional child .
She has no idea of what to expect, but has a vague idea about her biological parents .
She thinks they're young, but now before the meeting she tries to gather her thoughts, because she has so much to say, but nothing to reproach .
My parents are two mothers and two fathers .
But in the end, my parents are the ones who raised me .
It will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience .
"I hope to gain a beautiful memory after meeting them, because now there are so many things to say," confesses Crina .
The first family reunion in Ia»ôi
In Pia»õa Unirii, beneath the autumn sky, the family from Ruginoasa joins their destiny with their daughter in Palermo .
Crina is now 20, she's finishing high school according to the Italian school system, but she has the opportunity to begin a new chapter with Alina and Costel, her biological parents .
There are no more borders or countries separating them, just one barrier: the language .
This barrier is easily broken with the help of an interpreter, a local Italian owner whose establishment is located in the centre of Ia»ôi .
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say this is the first event of its kind, and that in the future, if they will have another chance to make it happen, they will do it .
It is the first event of this kind with such amount of emotion, and I'm glad it's a success .
The centre we work at conducts various activities and most times we are associated with an institution that only deals with drug consumers or addicts .
But we try to give something good back to the community .
"If I will ever be asked to participate in such activities, I will do it with all my heart", says RomicƒÉ Ichim smiling, the director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Assessment and Counselling in Ia»ôi .
Behind him, the Balcan family with Crina in the middle walk away telling stories .
It's quite understandable: they have much to say to each other .
Temporary truce, yesterday at PSD (Social Democrat Party) .
Everyone can catch their breath
The sides of PSD Branch of Iasi county concluded a temporary truce .
After multiple discussion sessions, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities .
Forced by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a unified position, the Social Democrats of Iasi county will send a whole list of potential candidates for the party's positions .
Far from being over, the party's internal war seems to be on a break to allow combatants to catch their breath .
Dragnea has not given an ultimatum .
He sent a very simple and timely message under current circumstances: try to find a solution in order not to jeopardize the party .
On October 3 we have elections within the party .
All the positions will be made available to those who want them .
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica .
The two days of discussions over the weekend led only to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established .
At the October elections for the presidency of the county branch of PSD a fierce competition is to be expected .
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position of the Iasi branch of the party is the Secretary of state Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, county councillor Vasile C√¢tea and Acting President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu .
The mayor of Schitu Duca commune, Mihai Mihalache, can also be added .
The candidacy of PSD county councillors leader Cristian Stanciu can also be a variant, if Lupu does not enter the race, as sources within the party say he is not interested in the position .
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of recent days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita .
The list of candidates is open .
According to the statute, applications may be submitted including in the election day and no one would be surprised if it happened .
"It is important we remain united and will remain so after October 3, when we shall have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and new leadership structures," stated C√¢tea .
Until the organisation of internal elections, the management of PSD county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu .
Lupu is still on vacation until September 29, the preparation of the elections being actually provided by the branch executive secretary, county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is not in the best terms with Nichita's followers .
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu stated that the recent discussions led to "a partial agreement" .
There is a wide openness to maintain balance and unity in the party .
A partial consensus was reached to support a unified team to manage the county .
"But on the other hand, there are many variants on the PSD presidential candidacy intentions in Ia»ôi county, as the list is still open," said Stanciu .
A judge from Iasi rejected the file of the rapists from Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven youngsters from Vaslui convicted of rape shell be heard today by the Court of Appeal Iasi .
The rapists whose sentences range from five years and eight months to eight years and four months will present arguments concerning their freedom today, after the trial court of Vaslui has requested their immediate incarceration after the sentencing .
The case was registered at the Court of Appeal last week, magistrate Dan Anton formulating a request of abstention which was admitted by his colleagues .
Anton claimed that one of the lawyers of the defendants, attorney Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, attorney Dana Anton .
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest penalty in this case .
How the judges motivated their sentence
Last weekend, the magistrate of Vaslui Court who convicted the seven youngsters motivated his sentence .
In his motivation, the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public .
"The court finds that after the moment the judicial control was placed under preventive measure, the measure of liberty restriction but not liberty deprivation, due to the impact of the attitude of the defendants and their families and local supporters, was felt in the local and national community as a strong sense of indignation regarding the fact that the individuals accused of serious offenses are tried under a less restrictive measure", states the motivation of the Vaslui Court .
Also, the magistrates ruled out the main defence of the seven defendants who, during the process, invoked that the girl they raped wasn't "quite a clean potato" .
"The court emphasises that the moral quality the victim is irrelevant, aspect which the defendants wished to highlight in their defence, as the physical and sexual liberty of a person cannot be violated under any pretext", adds the motivation .
Corbyn, the Brexit and the future of Europe
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue in the coming years .
By Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn is .
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are asking to what extent can we be affected by the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position to take decisions .
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of the Labour Party after the war .
Avowed Marxist, anti-monarchist (at one point he asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to eliminate the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he was otherwise a regular guest of the "Russia Today" television channel, and he would comment political events) . He is also a supporter of the Hezbollah and Hamas terrorist movements and wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and withdraw from NATO and the EU .
At the time, Corbyn thought that the killing of Osama bin Laden was a true tragedy and ISIS was almost to be preferred in comparison to the United States .
As all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, anti-austerity miracle solutions .
These kind of things were also said and promised by Tsipras in Greece until he came to close quarters with the real world and economic standards .
The economic program of the new Labour Party leader provides, among others, massive renationalisation and money printing as a solution for projects regarding financing development and coverage of generous social benefits .
Sure, some might ask why the money printing solution is not widely adopted around the globe . We would then have a general worldwide prosperity!, but who is going to beat his brain with such details .
Sure we can bleed white the bankers, who became a kind of usual enemies of the left wing, but from what we have seen so often in the past, this things have happened not only in the former communist countries or Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterrand and Hollande's mandates .
Additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous unsubstantiated pledges, made by populist demagogues .
As Margaret Thatcher used to warn, "the problem of socialism is that, at some point, you run out of other people's money" .
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister .
In the early 80s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot failed miserably in the elections . His beliefs were not as extreme as the one of the newly elected party leader .
But Great Britain still has a working class in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured .
Unions were significantly more influential than they are now .
Under the new industrial landscape, where all services are dominant in the workforce regarded as a whole, and extensive automation has led to an industry that needed massive highly qualified manpower, Corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal .
But even as part of the opposition, he can influence important developments that may affect us directly .
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit or the withdrawal of Great Britain from the EU .
The new Labour Party leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the European Union .
In the eyes of the radical left wing, Brussels is an agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation which imposed austerity to the poor .
When you combine this with the kind of ideas with the ones expressed by the radical right and the anti-immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis that shakes up the EU, you get an explosive mix .
And this is not valid only for the United Kingdom .
But if the British decide to leave the European Union as a result of the referendum, which would take place before 2017, the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep fault lines created within the EU by the Euro crisis and recently by that of the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, this leaves room for the most worrying scenarios .
The more so, since London has been a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming an increasingly dominant player) for a number of Member States .
It's true that the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates for remaining a member of the EU .
But the Europe of today is not what it used to be .
Resentment is currently growing in intensity .
The recent speech of Jean Clude Junker also revealed a problem which is that Brussels increasingly tends to make majour decisions without consulting the great majority of Member States, asking for the opinion of just a few European powers, mainly Germany .
This is happening while the electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration parties which are Eurosceptic at the same time, increases dramatically across the continent .
In other words, negatively charged emotional climate has reached levels higher than ever before .
Hence the conclusion that was drawn by the Financial Times when assessing the chances of Brexit .
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation departing from national interest .
If the voters will take the decision using their brain, then Great Britain will remain in the EU .
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in the politics of today .
Or, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such majour developments .
As expected, this will happen especially if we will see a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region to the outskirts of interest and to the decision-making process in Europe .
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric with the frustrations accumulated in the Western world .
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity, the generous social benefits enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue in the coming years .
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, Eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions which only took into account the integration political ambitions, and not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, turmoil on the continent , internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect Romania's situation .
It's hard to exclude possible scenarios .
The main question is whether our political leaders are able to face such difficult situations .
Constantin Brancusi, the peasant god .
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take the broom and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: to be somebody, to get famous, to be known worldwide .
Behind his reputation there is something else, something almost forgotten today . We hear millions of success stories, recipes for success in life .
That something has a name .
It's called "hard work" .
What else is there to be written about Constantin Brancusi?
What is there to say, really?
His face has appeared on banknotes .
Recently, a prominent bank in Romania has hired an actor to play him in a video ad .
Brancusi produces and delivers money nearly 60 years after he is no longer with us .
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and avenues that bear his name .
Moreover, even the author of this text resides on one of these streets .
When it comes to take the offspring out for a walk, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to Brancusi" .
The country is full of his statues .
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly .
Brancusi's penetration capacity is huge .
Even the communists have failed to extirpate him from the memory and culture of Romania .
The internet is full of his quotations, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares .
And then again, what else is there to say, to write about this man?
Seen from the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his destiny, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable .
You know, there are people who say that if you didn't have the luck to be born in a big city, in a wealthy family, your chances for success in life are virtually nil .
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample .
And perhaps this is the key .
Perhaps the following text should start here .
With a verdict, however detestable it may be .
Forget the stupid success stories, which are delivered daily to you in newspapers and on television .
Look carefully at the face of this man .
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how the whole world heard of him?
It's simple .
He worked his whole life to become someone .
That's what he did .
Constantin Brancusi was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobi»õa, a small village from Pe»ôti»ôani, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians .
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi .
Although he came from a wealthy family of farmers, Brancusi lived a modest life, but one that provided his milestones which will guide his artistic vision later .
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist was going to confess, in a meeting with Petre Tutea, in Paris in 1933: "Back then life was beautiful and harmonious" .
For millennia, people were living a happy, patriarchal life .
Everything progressed quietly from one season to another .
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city reached us .
But Brancusi's childhood was far from an idyllic one .
One of the moments of his first years of life is highly suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years spent in his hometown .
The moment is reproduced in "Brancusi . A Biography" by Alexandru Buican .
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old .
In the autumn of that year, when plum brandy was made in the alembic, Brancusi was watching those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was conducted properly, and he seized a moment of inattention .
He filled his cupped hands with brandy and drank in one gulp .
He fell asleep almost instantly .
The first people noticed after a few minutes .
His mother panicked, then became hysterical, believing her son is dead .
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returned from the vineyard accompanied by musicians, he saw desperate signs in the distance, the signs of those who were breathlessly waiting for him .
The party immediately turned into sorrow .
The father was already thinking of the burial .
Yet somehow, someone thought it would be better to call Baba Brandusa, a healer and servant of the Brancusi family .
Brandusa checked the child's breath, then put horse dung collected from the vicinity under his nose .
The child sneezed loudly .
The people applauded .
While the boy was allowed to sleep off his drunkenness, the party continued even louder and with more energy .
The next day, the father and the son meet in the orchard .
Radu Constantin Brancusi sent his son to gather some twigs and bring them to him .
The father holds his son upside down and whips him with the twigs, beats him to forever remember this .
While he feels the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that things around him can seem overturned .
The Sun's position is different from the one the boy knows, and this makes him wonder, as he later admits in his old age, that maybe the star itself brings its contribution to his trouble .
Is it possible that the Sun was as troubled as his father because of what had happened to him?
Currently, the city does not work
An MP calls on the politicians to remember those who voted for them .
Independent Deputy Viorel BlƒÉju»õ appealed to PSD (Social Democrat Party) and PNL (Liberal National Party) to cease their internal disputes and reorient their agenda towards the voters .
What we see now on our political scene is just a great disunion and nothing more .
I have not seen any USL (Social Liberal Union) projects from 2012 to continue .
No highway or Regional Emergency Hospital, you only see how the politicians argue over possible locations based on real estate interests .
We should let politics aside for a time, and we should meet to talk .
Currently, the city does not work .
"If you're busy with an internal war, you have no time for those who elected you," said BlƒÉju»õ .
He said that the current political class has disappointed the voters of Iasi county, and the consequence will be a very low presence at the upcoming local elections, at around 30%, which is virtually the parties' loyal electorate .
The deputy also believes that the voters will increasingly focus towards traditional parties, expressing reservations towards the new political initiatives, such as the Party "For Ia»ôi" which will be launched today .
Local parties have little chance and will only break the right wing's electorate, and not the one of PSD .
Such parties rely on civic active people, who are usually from the right wing .
"The right wing is crumbling further, which is not good for anyone, including PSD", said BlƒÉju»õ .
He said he is not interested in a candidacy for the upcoming local elections, denying the rumours of his intention to enter the race for the Mayor position .
I have already stated I do not want to run for any local position .
I'll think about whether to continue as a deputy for the next office .
I tried to make an appeal for unity for Iasi during the discussions on the hallways with the other MPs, and I was accused that I want to build an image .
This is not my intention, but we cannot continue in this way .
"If the people voted for us it does not mean they are stupid enough to vote for us again if they don't see anything," said BlƒÉju»õ, who stated that the main reason the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected persons .
A colleague from TƒÉtƒÉra»ôi said that he does not have enough money and he must go by bus .
Let us not be hypocrites .
Money is enough .
Sometimes I'm ashamed to take my money from the cashier's office .
At the end of the office I will report everything I spent besides the cabinet employees' salaries and its maintenance .
One month I happened to collect 30,000 lei with the reimbursements for transport, accommodation and other expenses .
"To say that an MP does not have enough money is pure hypocrisy" concluded little BlƒÉju»õ .
