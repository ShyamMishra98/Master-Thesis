UN chief says no military solutions to Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the conflict lasting nearly five years and more weapons would only exacerbate violence and suffering millions of people .
The UN chief urged all parties again , including the divided UN Security Council to unify and support negotiations in order to find a political solution .
Ban said at a conference Wednesday that he planned to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries permanently present on the council this month - the US , Russia , China , England and France - on the edge of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session to discuss Syria .
Ban voiced regret that divisions within the council and between Syrian people and regional powers &quot; have made this intractable situation . &quot;
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear weapons , tackling such a crisis in Syria .
8 figures in polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have been trying to label him as a &quot; fridge @-@ flop . &quot;
Others called him a joke .
And others await implosion .
But no matter how some Republicans try to remove Donald Trump from the top of polls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leads with a share of two figures and some are starting to ask himself seriously what this means for the chances of nominating real estate mogul .
Of course , it &apos;s still premature .
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republicans nomination .
Pundling shows that in the same period of 2011 , Rick Perry &apos;s lead was playing Herman Cain in the polls , but none of them won in any state in the nomination race .
And the reasons why it would struggle hard at the general election are numerous .
But outside groups like Jeb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth concede Trump &apos;s power and start backing him with money .
Next we present some figures in recent polls suggesting the real estate mogul isn &apos;t just anything passing :
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees .
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy , in mid @-@ June , a survey by Monmouth University shows just two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
By mid @-@ July , the percentage climbed to 40 per cent .
At the beginning of August , it was 52 per cent .
Currently six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump .
About three out of 10 say they have a negative view .
These numbers remain .
A survey conducted by Quinnipiac last week in Iowa concluded 60 % of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump .
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won &apos;t win the nomination race .
In a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; if Trump won &apos;t win the race for the nomination .
Only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if Trump wins the nomination race .
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm that Trump ( 43 per cent say would be &quot; excited &quot; about 40 per cent who say the same about Trump ) .
Closest to enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio , by just 21 per cent .
On the side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot; unhappy &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if Jeb Bush favourite wins the nomination race .
Most Republicans don &apos;t see Trump &apos;s temperament a problem .
Although Donald Trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and his bombastic style , 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide consider the real estate mogul with temperament temperament to be president , according to ABC News / The Washington Post &apos;s poll Monday .
Regent the same figures in the state of Iowa , where Trump 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be ruler , according to Quinnipiac poll last week .
Yet 44 per cent believe he lacks the personality needed to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents say temperament doesn &apos;t have what he looks like at the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are rife with the idea .
When I take the attitude of intellectuals , Republican voters find Trump authentic .
According to a CNN / ORC poll last week , on question who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race , four out of 10 said Trump .
The situation changed towards the end of July when four out of 10 would have gambled on Jeb Bush .
Full information : In the past , GOP voters didn &apos;t read very well the future .
During the same period of last elections , four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the nomination race , compared to just 28 percent for Mitt Romney .
But these figures show most GOP voters consider Trump &apos;s campaign plausible .
Even if Republicans or replay for another candidate ; Trump still tops everyone .
Some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to Trump &apos;s win while prop Donald Trump will split up to more than a dozen candidates .
But a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in hypothetical situation of collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates , almost always Trump will benefit from majority support .
Trump is in the distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina , 14 points from Marco Rubio , at 15 Walker points , at 19 points from Jeb Bush and eventually every 33 points against Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie .
It &apos;s almost on par with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would beat businessman by 19 points in hypothetical one @-@ one showdown at one .
Most supporters of Donald Trump say they have decided .
A new poll conducted Tuesday by CBS / NYT shows more than half of voters supporting Trump say they don &apos;t change their voting option .
Obviously , much can happen in this regard and nobody can say that they never change their mind .
46 % say it leaves the window open to the possibility of changing their option .
Yet Trump &apos;s most important contender is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but it &apos;s twice as likely that voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
Since Donald Trump called Mexico migrants &quot; rapists &quot; in his campaign &apos;s opening speech two months ago immigration was the central topic in campaigning for 2016 .
Some are incare that Trump &apos;s bombastic style will lead to a split between hispansive voters and the Republican Party and harm efforts of genre .
But according to ABC / Post poll Monday , six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
ASA that as long as immigration issue remains in the spotlight , so will Dolie Trump .
Frustration with authorities touches us .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters , largely because of their status of outlawns .
According to ABC / Post &apos;s poll Monday , six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience in government .
People are also upset by Washington .
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Sharks / Bloomberg shows three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with congressional Republicans &apos; performance in congress , 54 percent declaring themselves &quot; unhappy &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; nervous &quot;
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister &apos; s &apos;
Since his election , Corbyn &apos;s debut at PMQs has long been expected
Labour Party &apos;s new leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Ministry later on Monday , facing his debut for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Corbyn will address first of six questions he entitled shortly after lunch ; his performance will likely be closely scrutinised by media and Labour MPs .
In weekly appearances , he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts . &quot;
He also said he can drop several attendance and give them to his colleagues .
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn &apos;s first parliamentary test in position as leader , coming after calling a &quot; ghost cabinet &quot; and after his speech Tuesday at TUC annual congress .
Meanwhile , the Labour Party leader &apos;s decision to keep quiet at rossing the national anthem at a job held on Tuesday on the 100th anniversary of England &apos;s battle attracted criticism from Tory MPs and kept the headlines front page .
Mr Corbyn &apos;s decision not to sing national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he &quot; kept quiet respectfully &quot; and acknowledged British air Force heroics in England &apos;s battle . &quot;
But a member of Mr Corbyn &apos;s ghost cabinet , Owen Smith , told the Chapo &apos; Cabinet Cabinet that he would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem &quot; regardless of &quot; his faith that the monarchy should be abolished .
Around twelve ministers from the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn &apos;s lead team , arguing through differences of opinion tied to economics , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences &quot; get bogged down &quot; in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn &apos;s appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and the benefit cap .
Mr Corbyn told conference TUC that the Labour Party would bring changes whereby the limitation idea would be completely eliminated .
Hours later , Mr Smith , Labour Minister and Pennings , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; in exclusive opposition to government plans to cut the &quot; head &quot; levels from £ 26,000 to £ 11,000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron on the floor over the last decade since taking over the Conservative Party leadership .
The Labour leader , who promised a different approach to politics , says he has ideas &quot; from external sources &quot; for questions to ask Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 suggestions .
MP Islington North said PMQs involve a level of confrontation too high and would refrain from aftershocks and attacks , pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and challenges facing young people .
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle , the finance minister , will keep her seat at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad .
He also voiced the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally , saying he approached House of Deputies Speaker John Berkeley to discuss this issue .
In 2005 , when he took over , Mr Cameron said he wanted to drop his political style &quot; Punch and Judy &quot; often associated with PMQs but admitted several years later that he did not succeed in his move .
Since the first broadcast , in 1990 PMQs was seen as a key barometer of a leader &apos;s reasoning , of how he heads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among fellow lawmakers , though critics say he became a caricature and requires deep reform .

JD Sports boss says higher wages could harm expansion
JD Sports Chairman Peter Canngill says an increase in minimum wage in Britain could mean &quot; greater purchasing power in pockets of potential consumers . &quot;
But that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labour costs within the firm , he says .
Costs could impact on JD Sports expansion plans , he added , which might mean fewer new jobs .
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticised for his behaviour .
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been victim of collateral in the &quot; storm &quot; created around his friend Nick Kyrgios and his behaviour deserved more words of praise rather than criticism , in view of Tennis Australia President Steve Healy .
Kokkinakis , the younger side in the talented dusty dusty called &quot; Special Oaks , &quot; has often been dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous injury Kyrgios had towards Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament .
In a heavy qualifying match played soon after , in Cincinnati , the chair referee had to step twice to beat Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison , after whom Harrison said : &quot; Celtic should have put Kyrgios down and I should have put him to earth footy that &apos;s what he &apos;s like . &quot;
Although last seen making a dust rocket after having cramps on the muscle and missed a possible U.S. Open tournament upset Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was vigorously defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow where he is battling Sam Groth for second spot after Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup semifinal against England .
&quot; Something I feel strong is that in my view Thanasi was attracted a bit in conflict , &quot; Healy said .
The truth is he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused Crampe in the U.S. , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration towards himself and know Thanasi good enough to know they wouldn &apos;t be proud of that .
But let &apos;s be serious , he has mastered extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence .
He has an extraordinary team , he has a great family together and I think he was treated unfairly .
He &apos;s a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old who works hard and integrated into the team , he has had no clash with the other players , he trains hard , trains hard , he trains hard , he &apos;s in excellent form , he &apos;s a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves judged exclusively on his qualities and faults .
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the key replay match , starting Friday , and described the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the most suited to all but maintained the return of the player originally from Canberra in the long run in the team .
&quot; First of all , we want the team to fully focus on the replay match and don &apos;t think at all about the controversy around &#91; Kyrgios &#93; , &quot; Healy said .
And I think Nick climbed very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have said , he matured under the eyes of the public and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticised , but we try to support him , we try to help him understand the consequences of his facts and I think he needs a while not in the spotlight so he can reflect , good thing for both the team and him .
Election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s advantage over Bernie Sanders cut to half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two @-@ figure advantage in the Democratic race for nationwide candidacy , but Sens. Bernie Sanders wins the pitch .
Clinton is now backed by 47 per cent of Democratic voters ( falling from 58 per cent ) , while Sanders is second , by 27 per cent ( up from 17 per cent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has yet to announce whether he will run for president , is backed by 15 per cent of Democratic voters .
With at least five months before the primary election starts , most Democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say they decided on the candidate they will sustain .
But Clinton supporters are firmer in their choice than supporters of other candidates .
Compared to poll conducted by CBS News last month , Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups while Sanders won a few per cent .
Clinton retains the edge among women and moderates , but the advantage has dwindled .
Support among men has narrowed considerably and Sanders is just 5 points away .
Clinton &apos;s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 evaporates , now being on par with Sanders .
However , Clinton is still on edge among elderly voters .
Last month , Clinton stands outside Sanders , by a two @-@ figure percentage , among liberals , but Sanders now has a slight 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if elected to run on behalf of the party .
A quarter would be somewhat reserved for it , while another 15 per cent would only argue it for represent the party .
Six per cent wouldn &apos;t sustain it .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the likelihood that Clinton &apos;s current presidential supporters are excited about her choice is tall .
Opinions are more mixed among those who don &apos;t currently claim Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically .
While 48 % of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton , the number of Republican voters declaring the same about first @-@ ranked Donald Trump ( 35 per cent ) is smaller .
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why she would want her to win the race , the majority response is that she has adequate experience ( 16 % ) , followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president ( 13 % ) and that she is the best candidate for her function ( 10 % ) .
Supporters of Clinton also cite her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned .
Given that vice president takes into account a possible presidential bid , 57 % of Democratic voters would want to see him in the race - although one third think they shouldn &apos;t run .
At the question of the second option for the party representative , Democratic voters call Biden majority .
Of Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be second option , much ahead of Sanders .
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic party race , Hillary Clinton &apos;s advantage over Sanders grows , from 20 points with Biden to 30 points if he doesn &apos;t run .
55 % of Democratic voters see Clinton candidate with the biggest chance of winning the general election ; yet the numbers have fallen from 78 % as they were last month .
Biden is in distance from second but the percentage that he is most eligible has surged .
However , when asked what &apos;s most important to an elected candidate , Democratic voters prefer the issues instead of eligibility .
Like last month , no Democratic candidate or possibly candidate is considered by these voters as unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race .
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of several key features towards their party &apos;s primary voters .
Most voters see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as integral and trustworthy and have solid leadership qualities .
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity , while Clinton &apos;s strength point is leadership .
30 % of Democratic voters don &apos;t think H. Clinton is integrating and confident , twice as many than those who say this about Sanders ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have a view of him about it .
Democratic voters also believe overall that the trio , Clinton , Sanders and Biden , have the same ideologies as they do .
On all these issues , about a quarter of Democratic voters don &apos;t have a view of Sanders .
How questions persist about using a personal email address and Hillary Clinton email server when he was Secretary of State , most Democratic voters are happy with her explanation on the subject and say he hasn &apos;t affected her overall view of the candidate .
But things are different among the American public .
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their explanation , while only nearly a third are happy .
Public opinion split in March on the subject shortly after the matter emerged .
Most Americans say that controversy over email hasn &apos;t affected Trump &apos;s overall view of Clinton , although 36 percent say they have changed their view in negative sense .
Mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 , say they have changed their mind about Clinton in negative sense .
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton integrating and trustworthy , this remains to raise issues among voters globally : Only 32 per cent view it as integrating and trusting , 8 % fewer than last month and 15 % fewer than in May .
62 % of voters do not consider it integrated and trustworthy .
At the same time , 55 % of voters nationwide do not see Trump as inclusive and trustworthy .
Still , both Clinton and Trump have worked white for leadership .
Of the six candidates assessed , Biden , Carson and Bush rank first in integrity .
The number of those who view Sanders Paradise is higher than those who disagree , though , as in Carson , many lack a view of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 51 Democratic voters mayors is 6 percentage points .
Five faction charged over killing student in Year 1 at Barbour faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania , five people have been charged with murder .
Members of the Pi Delta PSI fraternity at the New York Faculty of Baruch brutally attacked chun &quot; Michael &quot; Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed taking him to hospital , contributing to his death , according to police statements .
Official sources say the victim was tied up , he was put in his back a 14 kg bag filled with sand and was handcuffed repeatedly while trying to head towards a target , on an icy pitch .
Mr. Deng blamed headaches after losing consciousness .
Members of the Pi Delta PSI fraternity did not call the emergency number after it fainted and claim they would have waited an hour before taking him to hospital , police say .
But they found the time needed to change Deng &apos;s clothes , seek her symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng , president of brotherhood nationwide , to ask for his advice , police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference .
&quot; At this point , members began concealing personal belongings and basically put the good of brotherhood ahead of the good Michael Deng , &quot; Wagner said .
He couldn &apos;t be resurrected and died the second day in the morning .
Under an autopsy report , Deng sustained repeated trauma to head , trench and couch .
&quot; Too many families were devastated by the rituals of brotherhood , since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year due to ritual rituals , &quot; Douglas Blackberg , Deng &apos;s family attorney , said in a statement .
Brotherhood and members must be held accountable and this step taken by authorities is important .
Monroe County grand jury recommended that the first five members be charged with second degree murder .
Thirty @-@ two mebries of the brotherhood , including Mr Meng , will also be charged for possessing and abetting murder .
&quot; We want to hold accountable not only to individuals involved but , if there is an organisation that authorised the Brotherhood , officially or informally , we will also shoot it accountable , &quot; Wagner told a news conference Tuesday .
The Baruch faculty banned brotherhood and national Brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with local representation .
IATA what happens when Fed raise interest rate
Interest rates will rise and the Bull market ( rising market ) will sink , bond profitability will rise , and the economy will fall into recession .
That &apos;s what we know .
What we don &apos;t know is how long it will happen and how tough it lasts .
In economics , history offers few clues to employment in time .
After the first increase in interest rates , the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months .
The federal Reserve &apos;s aggressiveness of raising interest rates is often , although not always , a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond .
That is why U.S. central bank officials have emphasised so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts raising interest rates but on the trajectories of the time needed for normalization .
Indeed , at stake there are multiple variables .
But finally , market players might find that all the hype surrounding interest rate hikes have been overblown .
&quot; The Fed &apos;s first rate hike decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , in a note to customers .
On the contrary , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels , but still small to constitute the seismic shock they seem to fear all .
But it cannot be argued that there will be no effects .
We continue to present how several sectors of the economy could react , relying on historic trends :
Given the situation experienced by the market over recent months , anticipation of an interest rate increase can freeze things a while .
But at the time of growth , the impact isn &apos;t so dramatic .
&quot; There seems to be a tendency that profitability of capital to falter for 12 @-@ 24 months after the first increase , reflecting perhaps once again the defect in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey of what will happen after Fed increases .
Specifically , in the last 35 years , the market has suddenly risen - by about 14 per cent - heading towards an interest rate rise , rather flammable within the 250 @-@ day period after ( averaging 2.6 per cent ) after returning to normal after 500 days , with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 per cent , according to a recent analysis in Barron by chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management .
Deutsche said impact on shares tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate hike cycle and benefits start falling .
Recession is a reality of economic life , but interest rate hikes often contribute to it .
In the present situation , Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate a recession .
Specifically , gross domestic product will close to its historic minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rates .
According to Deutsche Bank , of 118 interest rate hikes since 1950 , only twice nominal GDP was less than 4.5 per cent .
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 value was 3.6 per cent , few expect the situation to persist , with the third quarter reaching just 1.5 per cent , according to Atlanta Fed officials .
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question &quot; if this time it &apos;s different , &quot; Deutsche said .
Market Player have prepared all year for a Fed growth decision , with all eyes glued to this week &apos;s meeting of the Federal Committee of the Open Market Committee ending Thursday .
Although many strategists and economists believe FOMC could approve an interest rate increase during this meeting , futures trading indicate only 25 per cent probability .
&quot; In our study conducted after 1950 , all the cycles of interest rate growth so far have been in a super cycle of profit growth , GDP eclipse peaks ahead of recession very quickly after recovery started , &quot; the report said .
On the contrary , this was an odd recovery from slow after the worst recession in the period under consideration .
The current cycle is by far the longest awaited Fed since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months and it has reached 74 months and continues .
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an interest rate increase and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends .
The main difference is that the impact is faster in bonds than in the case of shares when Fed amends politics .
In bond case , benefits change the direction immediately what cycle growth / drop occurs .
At the end of the interest rate increase cycle , bond profitability decreases immediately , &quot; Deutsche said .
Strategists Charles Schwab believe these interest rate increases will determine profitability returns between short @-@ term bonds and long @-@ term bonds , aplenty and curve .
Bonds with high profitability are doing better in such an environment , although &quot; we are still wary of forcing profitability back , &quot; Kathy Jones , fixed income analyst at Schwab Schwab said in an analysis .
Interestingly , Jones believes markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations .
&quot; Besides the dollar strength and falling inflation estimated , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy , &quot; Jones wrote .
Short @-@ term interest rates have risen , courting profitability is weaker , GDP interest rate hikes have expanded and volatility has widened - all market characteristics when Fed tightens politics .
Broadly , companies operating majority activity in the US will benefit from raising interest rates and local products become more attractive .
Capitalists with high debts will suffer because dollar growth will lead to rising their products into global market space and their debt will be more expensive .
&quot; History shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in interest rates , &quot; analyst Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers .
Firms with strong balance sheets surpassed those with a weak balance after each of the interest rate increases since 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , with an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with large capital revenues and stocks with low volatility also surpassed similar companies with lower quality , averaging 4 ( percentage points ) respectively .
Debt will become an important issue .
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose , Goldman says .
Consumers will also benefit from raising the dollar .
Those who save may also have to gain , although experts disagree with how quickly that will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after TFM , says MP Andrew Bingham
Tory MP Andrew Bingham slammed radio because &apos; silly &apos;
It says it &apos;s increasingly similar to the commercial challenger
He also took to the eye of the BBC Music Awards , saying they dug the Brates awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice , calling either show original
BBC Radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; FoxFM , an important lawmaker said , putting pressure on the post proving he does something commercial broadcasters do not do .
Tory MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that public radio &quot; silly is &quot; and increasingly looks like the commercial adversary .
&quot; I have the impression Radio 3 &quot; silly &quot; - although I don &apos;t like using the word - but I have the impression that it turns into de FM , &quot; he said .
He also took to the eye of the BBC Music Awards , launched in December last year .
BBC Music Awards , launched last year , appear to be Brates under another name .
So if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that only duplicate what already exists in the market , &quot; said Mr Bingham .
The BBC director general denied allegations , saying BBC Radio 3 is well before its commercial opponent on live music and educating the public .
I &apos;m not going to be anywhere about classical music what I &apos;m sitting on Radio 3 .
And his commitment to live music and production doesn &apos;t have rival .
&quot; Furthermore , I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discovering new music and allocating new pieces , &quot; he said .
In the first part of this year , BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to work harder to attract audiences compared to the previous period because Britons have fewer knowledge of classical music .
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticised at their Culture , Media and Sports Committee meeting for going on the trail of its trading rivals .
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £ 22 million .
Do you understand why there is often talk of that issue because it is not original and does not distinguish itself from anything ?
Lord Hall insisted the show by BC1 - starring Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - realised &quot; in a specific BBC manner . &quot;
He added that he wants that Corporate &quot; find chicken egg egg in your own house &quot; next time launching an entertainment show .
However , he refused to ban on the future taking over new seasons in The Voice or spending money running on licences in other entertainment formats .
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and the culprit could be Black .
In the first three months of 2015 , online sales have risen 7 per cent .
Over the past month , there has been the slowest growth since 2000 .
Online sales took off three years ago thanks to using mobile phone to shop .
Specialists believe that Black Lerner in November may prompt reluctance to spend .
For more than a decade , online shopping exploded and turned UK shopping streets into ghost towns .
But specialists say there are signs online sales are shrinking , with latest figures indicating an increase of just 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015 .
Total money spent in August presented its lowest growth since 2000 to date , with an increase of just 5 per cent over the past year .
Specialists say there are signs online sales are shrinking , with latest figures indicating an increase of just 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; If we look at the growth level in previous years and come back by 2000 , there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time , &quot; Andy Mulcahy , editor of the IMRG sales index , told the Guardian .
He explained online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using mobile phone to shop .
So it grew up the number of people who could shop online and could do it in diverse circumstances such as from canapea .
But now that a little stagnating , you could see a ( growth ) slump .
The phenomenon of Black Champion , imported from America , is listed as one reason for declining sales .
In specialists &apos; view , shoppers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event which occurs in November &apos;s latest Friday .
Last year , five times the average number of shoppers flocked to computers to put hands on bids , which led to the collapse of several retailers &apos; websites .
Specialists believe Black Sharks when shoppers beat bargains could prompt buyers &apos; reluctance .
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1,000 of every 5 genre is spent online .
In the case of certain products , such as televisions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are currently carried out via online shops .

The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walking on the streets of Muslims , with the first funeral taking place in Mecca .
Saudi Arabia partially blamed giant construction giant Binladin Group for collapsing .
Health minister said total 394 people injured following cranes collapse
In the street walk ceremony , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims , killed because of collapsed cranes at the vast mosque in Mecca .
Dressed in white , those crying dead joined the road to express their condolences , until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey at Al @-@ Moorem cemetery .
The sad reminder retained by the holy place , where just days ago a building machete collapsed through tavern Mosque &apos;s tavern , falling to worshippers .
The bodies were released for the funeral after Saudi king sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group for disaster , which also resulted in 394 wounded .
At the ceremony in the street , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims , killed because of collapsed cranes at the vast mosque in Mecca .
Among the dead included four children &apos;s father Qasim Akram , of Bolton , Great Manchester , on his first pilgrimage when cranes crashed .
Mr Akram is in the Great Mosque with his parents before the hajj pilgrimage began annually .
Saudi authorities have already pledged that hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue , with thousands of pilgrims coming to the city further .
Today King Salman said the group of Binladin shouldn &apos;t have left arm cranes high as macara was not in operation .
An Arabic version of the decree , published by the Saudi press agency , said the group Binladin partially bears fault for collapse .
The news agency &apos;s English service did not present the detail , but said company leaders had been banned from leaving the country .
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of cranes in the court of Great Moskeys , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came ahead of the hajj pilgrimage taking place later this month .
The group Binladin has yet to comment on the collapse of cranes , and Group representatives could not be contacted for statements .
The royal decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its work with weather authorities .
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque Sea in Mecca as part of the massive building effort led by the Binladin group .
For decades , family Binladin has a close relationship with Saudi Arabia &apos;s royal family and runs major building projects .
Last Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was a &quot; renegade , &quot; disinherited by family in the 1990s .
The prince came under strong wind and rain conditions , just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to attend the pilgrimage , essential journey at least once in the lives of each Muslim fit physically .
Authorities say 158 remain in hospital .
Authorities have decided that relatives of the deceased victims receive one million Saudi Rikers ( £ 174,000 ) and same amount to pay those with permanent injuries .
Other injured will get half of that amount .
Pros and cons of Swiss franc loan conversion
Two offers of loan conversion in the Swiss franc have already appeared on the banking market , with main advantages being excluding currency risk exclusion and lowering rates .
Disadvantages can come across several years , when variable interest can lead to raising rates .
The Transylvania Bank has just finished the process of converting credit to francs granted by Volkbank , and the Post Bank posted the conversion offer for its own customers .
Under cumulative data by analysts at Finzoom Financial portal analysts , the Post Bank offers three years of fixed interest to lions , 1.5 per cent , the smallest from the market .
On the other hand , the Transylvania Bank conversion offer was accepted by 83 % of loans in francs thanks to two successive cuts : Solitude with the value of risk fees and administration paid by the customer was reduced , then an additional 22.5 per cent reduction in solitude in lions applied .
Both offers reduce their own customers &apos; rates , compared to how monthly Plateau pays equivalent to lions before conversion .
Thus , Banca Transylvania cuts rates by 42.5 % and the Post Bank , 33 % in the first three years and theoretically by 18 % over the coming years .
Benefit
The main advantage of the credit crunch &apos;s main advantage in CHF is that exchange risk is eliminated , with consumer protected by future franchise increases and repayment will be done in the currency where they collect their salary .
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no reassessment of property is made , additional guarantees and another sign of revenue are not required .
There will basically be no new financial and financial analysis of credit nor will there be additional costs as in the case of new funding .
Also , both banks offer discounts to the monthly rate , compared to how customers pay before conversion , equivalent to lions .
Risks
The problem is that the early @-@ year rate consists of more of interest and the recipient reimbursed very little mainly .
The Post &apos;s offer of very little interest in the first three years seems advantageous to customers .
But it is unclear how this interest will evolve after three years .
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25 per cent , so in total , and cutting costs is lower .
A possible risk to all credit in low @-@ variable lions , is that ROBOR Index grow significantly over the next few years ( more than the Libor Index - CHF ) .
For example , ROBOR to three months now stands 1.44 % , but in 2013 it reached 6 % value , in 2009 , at more than 15 % and within days of 2008 exceeded 40 % !
Furthermore , there may also be other costs , unlisted in the initial offering .
The timing of interest rate decisions for US Federal Reserve arrived
The world is looking at its scheduled meeting in two days , Wednesday and Thursday when the US Federal Reserve takes its crucial decision whether to increase or not interest rates for the first time after about a decade .
In a Reuters poll with the participation of 80 economists , slightly more than half who thought the decision would be taken , I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates would be retained in the current 0 @-@ 0.25 % range .
It &apos;s a historic event because they have passed seven years since the Fed brought rates to zero .
For the first time we are facing a situation where a major central bank might drop its zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates , &quot; said Angel Ubide , chief analyst at the company on Institute for International Economics .
The US economy has evolved relatively well , with recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating low inflation levels .
But the Fed must not ignore the less rosy global situation .
Warned markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely .
The decision will be announced Tuesday , 20 : 00 CET .
Stars who lost their chunks
The actor ( left ) , along with his son Vicky ( right ) , has undergone stressful situations in recent years .
In 2001 he battled leukemia and in 2009 lost her partner of a life , Farrah Fawcett , in front of cancer .
The actor is also rumoured to have faced drug use problem and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession .
All this certainly has a cost .
Manchester United player Luke Shaw sits on the bar several months due to double fractures .
Luke Shaw suffered double bogeys on his right leg in Manchester United &apos;s match against Manchester United in the Champions League finish with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven .
After the event that brought tears to the player &apos;s eye and keep the bar for at least six months , Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw will be able to play his season again .
Injury occurred following reckless intervention from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw , 20 , smashed PSV defence .
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
Van Gaal said : &quot; He has double fractures on leg and is in hospital . &quot;
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow , and then will be operated in Manchester .
It &apos;s awful - a boy who came to Manchester United since he had 18 carries difficulties , then plays fantastic and now like that .
In the vestige he was put his oxygen mask .
Playing .
I am not a doctor , but a double replay fractures is six months old and will not play in the group stages .
I hope they can play this season again .
Moreno appears to have had luck and escaped red card and concession a penalty kick .
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish Mexican .
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong .
You can judge alone when they say it &apos;s foul and red card .
It was very ugly meditation , with two legs .
A message on Shaw &apos;s Twitter account : &quot; Thank you all for your messages , I have no words to express how weakened I feel , I &apos;m starting the journey towards recovery , I &apos;ll come back stronger . &quot;
Similar news : Manchester United hit by injury against Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
England &apos;s team @-@ mates have an extra reason to recover to play at France &apos;s European Championship next year in June .
Phillip Cocu , coach PSV , said : &quot; It &apos;s a very ugly injury . &quot;
Everyone is very sad when one player suffers such injury .
Our Player of the Year never watch to injure an opponent .
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico &apos;s national flag against Holland &apos;s team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship .
&quot; II is very hard because he didn &apos;t intend to hurt his opponent , and when you hear he &apos;s a very serious injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Cocu said .
I didn &apos;t see the stage .
I didn &apos;t manage to see than the ball , heading in another direction , so it seemed like &#91; Moreno &#93; reached it but we couldn &apos;t see the intervention on Luke .
In his statement for SBS6 , Moreno said : &quot; I know how it &apos;s , I know how difficult it is to get through something like that .
I feel bad , sorry , sorry .
PSV player Andrés Battado has also reached hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling .
Adam Lyth clearly risked England &apos;s omission but still holds out loud
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament , I &apos;m not taking into account a repeat defeat of 3 @-@ 0 in Test matches .
I would not eliminate any possible trip victory either .
Perhaps Alastair Cook &apos;s team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on thorn in the batting line and collective morale is strong ; they will not be marked by the 2012 developments but will have a youthful positive attitude .
Moeen Ali evolves as spider and Adil Rashid , even if he &apos;s unknown at the Test level , represent an option for the attack .
Similar subjects : Adam Lyth left England team for Test matches and was replaced by Alex Helected
Obviously as his main coach at Yorkshire , it &apos;s difficult to look at the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team .
Played his seven Test against two good strikers , in difficult conditions and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged after results .
There were no questions about Joe Root , for example , until the announcements were made because - and I said that previously - players are their own selection .
Any fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have extended his Lib Dems but his destiny lies in his hands .
I hope if he does more cricket for Yorkshire will have other opportunities .
England &apos;s leading coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when performance wasn &apos;t on his ability and doesn &apos;t surprise me this ; before all , he &apos;s a team man .
It &apos;s hard to respond to the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the Test matches .
Lyth had seven tweets - like Sam Robson ahead of him - while Nick Compton had nine .
Only Compton had luck at home and travelling .
The only grievance you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean Tour - when Lyth was in full form - but that missed opportunity is of the past .
Teamwork comes Alex Helected , a batsman I &apos;m scoring very well .
He &apos;s a cricket player who has &quot; X Factor &quot; and whom I &apos;ve noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Sharks .
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before us , but this will naturally depend on the composition of the UAE team .
It was launched the idea that Moeen would open to beating alongside Cook , which would lead extra spimp while preserving four bucks , and I have nothing against .
I don &apos;t see why a pitcher couldn &apos;t hit there and this left @-@ hander player has already shown he &apos;s given naibies .
Perhaps Moeen didn &apos;t bring success in his district , Worcestershire , but it was No 3 for them , so the difference isn &apos;t great .
My old team teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches 38 as Treasurer before entering open in 2001 .
He deleted three centuries immediately and didn &apos;t look behind .
Zafar Anjump comes to the team on the back @-@ up job spider , and although I &apos;ve had limited contact with him , he struck me as a very impressive young man .
People might judge early early age - with an average of 31 to beating and 35 at the ball - and they might think it &apos;s a password , but there &apos;s no bunch of nests and selecting opted for youth .
He &apos;s going to learn a lot from this tournament .
England have brought some changes to the coaching team as well .
Mahela Jayawardene &apos;s appointment to Sri Lanka &apos;s batsman as a consultant for test matches could be a master blow .
He &apos;s one of the best players and he &apos;ll bring great experience , given he played in any situation and against all sorts of attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes for White &apos;s White Bowl player and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition .
I &apos;ve always thought he was born to engage in international cricket , whether as a player or as a coach , and like Mahela , he has intuitive .
Sometimes new voices in the vestige , even though they convey messages that have passed away and previously , can bring fresh air into the team .
Colly Durham teammates Ben Stokes rest for one @-@ day matches , Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
While I &apos;m not all OK , coaches and selecting do not do the program .
And you have to note , players &apos; jobs depend on the results they get .
Such decisions never take lightly .
Brexit camp may win win if economics keep in disarray by 2017
As he passes , David Cameron &apos;s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU getting louder into the mess , even without picking brilliant Jeremy &quot; Yes or not ? &quot; Corbyn at Labour leadership or TTIP brings serious criticism from Europe Tuesday .
Strangers also have characters such as Corbyn and Nigel Farridge .
A European diplomat explained last days that -- submerged in crises similar to that in the EU - not all domestic injuries - some member states are powered by Britain &apos;s agenda of concessions and changes to the treaties , which most do not want .
In Brighton , during the annual meeting , TUC decided they didn &apos;t even want it if they erode social protection .
We might even call Dave and George &apos;s agenda &quot; selfies . &quot;
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , do a poise in front of a famous local monument , with or without local representative , then return home and say they have gained allies for reform .
It &apos;s just about me .
My European friend , who wants a Great Britain with the prospect of outside under the EU roof - &quot; Don &apos;t let ourselves alone with France , &quot; Berlin says - suggests that more ministers and shortsighted officials from some capitals have reached the point where they don &apos;t care whether they stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , the highly cautious German chancellor , is a but has been at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation clapped up , like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) who sat too much .
In 2017 French President François Hollande will be re @-@ elected or replaced .
And his strength is in decline .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right @-@ wing government , Spain one wing .
It &apos;s hard to believe they will help the English who pose , whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from getting out of Britain - something they don &apos;t want either , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
So some ministers might even tend to even intentionally make remarks that do not help , in SNP style , in campaigning for Britain &apos;s 2017 referendum to speed up the Brexit process , my ammy suggests .
&quot; Renegotiation was fixed &quot; and &quot; Britain has achieved nothing of value from renegotiation . &quot;
Europeans know on their skin how vibrant Street can be and how sceptical they are from the oligarchy media who view the EU with skepticism as they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 referendum in report 2 : 1 .
He can vaguely recall Boris Johnson , the Euro @-@ opportunistic , who became famous in the early 90s when he was fond of Brussels .
Ed Miliband knew his enemies .
They included the mixture of finding non @-@ deductible , strangers who defraud phone and pseudo @-@ domi holding most important newspapers .
In fact Tony Blair is seeing them a little bit like he realised that when Esti locked in a cage alongside a nervous gorilla , you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating at lunch and again at tea .
In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron &apos;s idea of referendum , considering Blair made a nod to the principle of the abandoned EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , giving him a exit card .
Media didn &apos;t forgive him for that either .
But Jeremy Corbyn , who has reached me girlfriends in his back Monday at Westminster - told him not to consume his time with me anymore - appears at risk to pass the Murdoch boycott strategy from 1980s , a mistake then and now .
It can take , but they have to develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media , not mine with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position on the BBC left her holiday Sunday .
Corbyn &apos;s official position towards Europe is what I would call for evolution .
He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU .
Most of those who disagree with the Conservatives &quot; anglicism &quot; might agree to that .
That &apos;s what Hilary &quot; A Benn , but not a Benn &quot; Benn on radio and TV this week , when the researcher in him struggled not to admit that John McDonnell &apos;s appointment by Corbyn as &quot; shadow &quot; minister on financial issues was a bad idea .
He reminded me of the 1970s when his father struggled on TV to be unfair to fellow Labour colleagues without going too far and without losing his job in cabinet .
Hilary &apos;s battle was more attractive .
But the fight to remain &quot; in any situation &quot; - Benn &apos;s expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said , nor what JC told colleagues and MPs during private meeting Monday night .
Regardless of the picture Corbyn wants to convey it out - note , it has reminded me and me - discipline discipline remains important in the era of television and especially in the limelight of social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It &apos;s fair not to be given Cameron a ticket for favour in Europe , allowing him to take good backing Labour in the referendum campaign , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that .
But McDonnell &apos;s core softness and Corbyin on EU membership - in line with their EU membership - in line with their anti @-@ capitalist past - no longer constitute just a heated discussion among leftist dissidents why the narrative of small gap is a central dogma .
As with his driving force on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not make the exit campaign - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital Berlin - and there are suspicious voters there - for concessions towards Britain when everything might be worthless ?
The US is already pretty disappointed about the poor Brazilian military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a conservative government cutting costs , as reminded me at launching British Airways at the Security Forum , on Monday .
Specialists criticise England Public Health Department decision on electronic cigarettes
According to the researchers , what a government agency said that electronic cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people , some of which links to tobacco industry .
Specialists from the British British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) editorial team experts joined Lancet in criticising evidence used by the Public Health Department of England ( PHE ) in its report on electronic cigarettes .
PHE published the &quot; landmark &quot; report last month and described it as a &quot; complex analysis of evidence . &quot;
But several researchers questioned the data sound robust and pointed fingers at links between certain experts and tobacco industry .
An article published last month in Lancet medical magazine attacked the &quot; extraordinarily fragile basis &quot; he founded PHE the main conclusion .
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have questioned what they said and set themselves &quot; on solid earth or on mystical sand . &quot;
Martin McKee , a European public health professor at London School of Hygiene and tropical Sharks , and Simon Capewell , professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University , said : &quot; A fundamental principle of clinical health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
They said they expected Ms E &apos;s claims that &quot; current estimates show electronic cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; are underpinned by detailed analysis of evidence and patterns .
In truth , one meeting attended by 12 people led to drawing up a model analysis model with multiple criteria ( MCDA ) to synthesized their views on negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine ; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper .
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company titled EuroSwiss Health , which executive director said had previously received financing from British American Tobacco for conducting an independent study .
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability , he said .
They added that one of 12 attendees at the meeting said funding received from an electronic cigarette maker , but not funding which there were reports that there would be reports of cigarette producing company Philip Morris International .
Arguments were not provided on the basis of which arguments on which table members were selected , but among them were several &quot; petals &quot; known in electronic cigarette production , some even say in work finance industry funding .
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
The head of the tobacco control section at PHE was also attended at the meeting .
The group research drafted &quot; convincingly whitewashed &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; solid evidence of the detrimental effect most of the products have according to most criteria , &quot; McKee and Capewell said .
However , in the PHE report , none of those links or limitations are mentioned .
McKee and Capewell said Ms PHE claims that &quot; so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes constitutes a factor encouraging smoking among children or non @-@ smokers &quot; are premature .
Professor Kevin Fenton , director of PHE health department health department , says she has responded in the past to what BMJ claims .
He said : &quot; Electronic badges are significantly less harmful than smoking &quot;
One in two people who smoked all life loses his life because of this vice president .
All evidence suggests the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health are minor compared , but we must continue to study the effects in the long run .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about information arising and those which do not stem from evidence , especially given the high degree of public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
Annually , some 880,000 people lose their lives because of an associated disease associated with smoking , while annual costs incurred by the NHS because of smoking reach £ 2 billion .
Clearly Expreview the current evidence - namely that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks , they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfil our national duty .

Ads shame Britain &apos;s arms trade
Watch the video by Amnesty International against the Weapons Fair .
Horrific deadly drones !
Fix for crushing glezes !
Cluster bombs !
And electrical batons causing horrible pain without letting traces !
The joyful voice and animated footage does not leave doubt that this advert for the largest world arms fair is a fierce blade by Amnesty International to highlight the desire of British authorities to sell weaponry to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Squad through Sony Centre in the London &apos; Docklands .

But a separate campaign also led to the display of large numbers of posters in bus stations and in theaters needing a second look .
&quot; Important announcement , travel with DLB between 15 and 18 September ? &quot; Says one of the ads , using phoning and branded London subway , the DHS line turning them into a tank &apos;s image .
In September this year , a lot of weaponry dealers will burst into customers &apos; DHS customers are asked to help stop the Weapons Fair .
The 300 posters are conducted by artists who exposed works to the Chanel Depot Museum in Dismaland , Banksy .
A group called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute in London using &quot; Ad Space Hack Peak , &quot; a £ 6 jockey Allen said , &quot; facilitates access to around a third of advertising space from bus stations on the planet . &quot;
London Transport Officer is not amused by this &apos; vandalism &apos; as leaflets .
One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group .
According to Gavin Grindon , curator Rachel Deeigh and a lecturer at Essex University , artists are asking more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside of galleries .
Many artists head to collaboration with activists in protest movements , realising they have to get out in the real world so that their art impacts society .
Another poster against gun trade welcoming commuters circulating underground .
The footage produced by Amnesty had more than 100,000 Facebook views within 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency who worked pro bono , and graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was shocked by the silence around advertising for the arms fair - with empty space on the Exeter calendar - and thought &quot; Let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
They played with making a more realistic advert but &quot; enriching it with loud animations and colors , it was more striking . &quot;
&quot; They did a great job helping us increase interest in selling equipment of illegal torture under the Fair , &quot; says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty .
Now , it would require UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door .
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the Weapons Fair comes from inside Miami , where exhibitors offer fantastic products of euphemism .
In a press release , Saab leaked an order received from the US military on &quot; AT4CS RS with support launcher . &quot;
It includes &quot; a unique form fox that gives stunning effects behind the armur inside the target .
Whatever it meant , it won &apos;t be pleasant .
Eight gold rules to live in Camin
It &apos;s been 11 years since I moved to Camin , when I was a 19 @-@ year @-@ old , who still believed in Berete and moral dexterity , but barely now I remember forced smiles of those I annoy I am - and the numerous complaints to others .

Violinist David Grimal : In Bach &apos;s era there were no world tournaments .
Beethoven , Brahms , Barbour , Enescu were people who worked , artists rather than commercial representatives .
French violinist David Grimshaw is one of the great artists of our time , known not only as solist but also as initiator of a less ordinary project , downright &quot; bizarre , &quot; as he even says , Les Dissonoo - an orchestra consisting of international soloists and talented musicians , who performs a symphonymous repertoire without having a conductor , and that makes it at least a curiosity in classical music landscape .
Les Dissonoo was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances : A performance , Sunday , in which solist was David Grimshaw , founder of orchestra , and one on Monday , when cellist Xavier Phillips was located at the forefront , with works made by The Hague being unrated .
Both performances , deployed on the Athlete stage , have shown audiences another way to interpret classical music .
Les Dissonoo appeared on the musical scene in 2004 being , at the time , the only classic musical ensemble in which there was no conductor .
Conductor is the musician most important to musicians .
True , on the one hand musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they talk of instrumentalists rather than composers .
They &apos;re trained as &quot; specialist workers . &quot;
They themselves have the impression they need a conductor .
On the other side of the scene , for the public , everyone feisty musical focuses on panache .
And so the Treasurer , the music industry , is doing its marketing .
So don &apos;t talk music anymore .
So if you look around this world , we have on one side skilled labourers , which is stupid , and a audience who cannot listen but you have to watch , which is stupid , &quot; finds David Grimal .
Violinist recounts that this shift in how he makes music came following his &quot; musical deception &quot; from his solitary career .
I was like a high @-@ level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras , to earn a lot of money and bring money and the music industry .
10 years ago , when we had around 30 years old , we found this very depressing , because we were no longer complaining about the creativity and the Human fraternity in this system .
So I didn &apos;t find any sense to continue on this road .
So I decided to create Les Dissonoo .
This happens in 2004 , and at the time no one was doing something like this without a conductor : &quot; The music world , extremely conservative , did not want such projects . &quot;
&quot; How do you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego anymore ? &quot; Asks the artist .
David Grimshaw acknowledges that Les Dissonaques represents &quot; a luxury , &quot; making it clear that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live .
In 10 years of having the ensemble , the lack of a conductor didn &apos;t prove to be a stumbling block in the song act : &quot; Curiously , the more complex repertoire plays , the simpler it looks , because all musicians are forced to be present in opera and not only in their role , &quot; Grimal argues , adding that on Sunday &apos;s show &quot; I was 74 conductors on stage . &quot;
In Grimal &apos;s view , the Enescu Festival is &quot; very courageous , &quot; precisely because it invited and Les Dissonerner : &quot; An extraordinary festival , where the greatest orchestras in the world singing and 3 times a day are present , and in the middle of these guest orchestras and this strange group . &quot;
In a temple of the orchestrated tradition , like it is the Enescu Festival , there is room and interest for something different , breaking barriers .
Speaking about Enescu opera , violinist admits he feels Romanian music of his famous Romanian composer , so he didn &apos;t need a special approach when he introduced baseball works into his repertoire .
Grimal notes that Enescu &apos;s music is very instinctive , but that happens when we speak of George Enescu and Romanian music , &quot; because there is also a George Enescu who did French music . &quot;
Grimshaw campaigns to change the way classical music education is made , believing that &quot; musician profession as organised today has a dying iz &quot; and that &quot; the future of music is music itself . &quot;
We don &apos;t need to tour the world 5 times a year if it serves nothing .
In Bach &apos;s era there were no world tournaments .
Beethoven , Brahms , Barbour , Enescu were people who worked , who were artists rather than commercial representatives .
For me , organising concerts , festivals , tours , launching whites , all are formidable , extraordinary , but as long as they do in music service .
If we do not , we are in a system where creativity suffers , it no longer has freedom .
To illustrate this phenomenon , David Grimal gave example to Romanian products before and post accession to the European Union : &quot; In Romania before you enter the EU , you had good vegetables and meat . &quot;
To enter the EU you had to adopt sanitary laws which are not good for vegetables and meat .
Production and agriculture reach the supermarket service , as is also the case in France .
With music happening the same thing , it &apos;s the same logic .
Les Dissonoo makes tomatoes maybe not too nice , but when you cut them are true tomatoes .
In an ideal world , this music should be returned to the centre and that the institutions and industries managing this system understand that music doesn &apos;t need to be sold but needs to be shared , and this can be done from educational policy .
&quot; If we thought - as the Koreans do , the Chinese , the Japanese - that Western music is one of humanity &apos;s most beautiful things , we would reintroduce learning to school , reintroduce concerts on TV and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical products , &quot; Grimal believes .
They &apos;re certainly things in classical music education that remains very communist , that &apos;s everywhere , it &apos;s something very militarised .
It depends on this discipline if you compare a musician to a soldier , or if we form a musician who performs at an instrument , being , first of all , a musician .
We talk of a completely different education if we want to form a soldier ( this education - n.red.) must be somehow , if we want to form a musician , it &apos;s altogether different .
After your closet , what &apos;s more dangerous , a soldier or musician ? &quot; Asks French artist smiling .
Grimal shows that for artists , the reward of another way to make music comes just from overcoming this status of &quot; soldier , &quot; overcoming what &quot; they think are their limits &quot; : &quot; Musicians discover they are their limits &quot; : &quot; Musicians discover at some point that they &apos;re not soldiers , and that is why after the concert I &apos;m smiling . &quot;
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist as part of the &quot; Festival of ideas , &quot; a discussion with the public at George Enescu International Festival by Institute Aspen Romania .

Cinema City looks for &quot; tiny Greater Voices &quot;
Cinema City launches biggest baby challenge : Doubling of two characters from superproduction &quot; Craaking 3D snow &quot;
Have you a super talented and spontaneous kid who likes films ?
Gives him the chance to get the star out .
In September , under the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children , keen to get future stars and who have between 8 and 16 , Cinema City is looking for &quot; tiny Big Voices , &quot; giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film .
If classic discounters focus on approaching the actor &apos;s voice on animated personalisation lately , the creation of the story is considered also those who follow to interpret voices , and they are usually very well @-@ known actors .
Cinema City Romania , however , wants to discover new voices and therefore launch an unprecedented campaign .
We want to find the right voice and cause parents to enroll their children at our contest .
They &apos;ll have special experience because characters are sympathies and replication are fun .
&quot; Children will have fun and will have a real opportunity to be part of a team of actors , &quot; Ioana Ionescu , Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania , said .
In the first leg of the contest , from September 11 to September 30 , Cinema City holds a shortlist behind which 10 children ( five girls and five boys ) will have their chance to perform in a recording studio alongside professionals .
All parents have to do is access the micilmemorimari.cinema @-@ city.ro platform , where to score the child to contest and prepare it for voice probation .
Later , they have to choose one of four films available on the platform , downloading texts that the child is going to read and then , the child will register performing its own double version of double .
Four films about friendship , fairytale heroes , magic and Hope can choose competitors for supporting proof : &quot; Mutiny Galbene Bill , &quot; &quot; Mune : The guardian of 3D Moon , &quot; &quot; Blinky Bill : Koala at 3D print &quot; and &quot; Albinuta Maya 3D . &quot;
Finally , the brightest two children ( a girl and a boy ) will see their dream turned and double how much of a character in superproduction &quot; The Snow Queen - Craighting 3D snow , &quot; which will premiere in Romania this November .
FedEx Cups mixed , drops fiscal forecasts for 2016
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the last quarter , with gas giant reducing profit estimates for all year following low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its land transport division .
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers over the holiday period .
During the same period last year , FedEx announced it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers over the holiday period .
Company shares fell about 2.5 per cent in pre @-@ market trading , 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday &apos;s opening bell bell bell bell bell bell bells .
FedEx Corp. said they expected to earn between $ 10.40 dollars and $ 10.90 dollars for fiscal year ending in May next year , 20 cents less , according to an earlier estimate .
Analysts expected to have $ 10.84 dollars , according to a survey by Fairfax Media .
The falling estimate comes despite prices rising 4.9 per cent on average , with entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharge for land transport of big stakes or high weight , which will apply since November .
The company said it expects further gains from the previous year as a result of cutting costs , higher revenues and developing online commerce .
President and director general Fred Smith said &quot; the company faces considerably weaker economic situation than expected , particularly in terms of global production and trade . &quot;
Job plans during the holidays were announced a day after UPS contestant said he planned to hire 990,000 @-@ 95,000 extra workers , about the same number of hiring workers he did last year .
In the quarter ending on 31 August , FedEx earned $ 692 million , 6 per cent more than the previous year .
Castigins per share was $ 2.42 , below its average estimate of $ 2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the ZucInvestment Research poll .
Profit rose 5 per cent to $ 12.3 billion .
Six analysts who participated in Zomesdale &apos;s poll of $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has been hit in recent years of a decline in international priority shipments , leading to stagnation in revenue recorded by its Express unit .
But the blast in online shopping salutes the results of the FedEx Plus division .
During the last quarter , revenues of the German division grew by 29 % , but operating revenues have virtually stalled because of higher costs for large packages and own insurance .
The express unit registered revenue growth thanks to higher base tariffs , while revenue from Freetown Division fell due to rising costs .
In pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening sound , FedEx shares had risen 3.85 dollars or 2.5 per cent , to $ 150.15 dollars .
Tuesday at closure had risen 11 per cent year @-@ on @-@ year and 17 per cent from its record maximum on 11 June .
During the most expected meeting in years , policymakers at the Fed will spend two days this week around a table of mahon Honduras with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Above them , at an end of the central bank &apos;s sitting room , a mural painting of the United States will be seen .
The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen , Fed President , and her colleagues must put the nation &apos;s economic interests above anything .
Central bank has received a double task from Congress : Maximise employment rates in the US and maintain price stability .
But since the big economic crisis , Fed leaders have confirmed there is a third unwritten task : Financial stability .
And this third task could be the X factor in a decision too difficult to predict , which will be announced on Tuesday , and determining whether the US economy is ready to be dislocated by the unprecedented incentive provided by the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate offered by nearly zero interest rates in force since late 2008 .
Even though most data point to strong growth , recent buzz on global financial markets may scare Fed officials already wary of adding volatility by raising the volatility by raising its benchmark rate to federal funds - even only by a percentage point percentage point .
&quot; Obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects they will follow , &quot; said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at brokerage firm Stigen Nicolaus &amp; Co .
&quot; However , I think if they seek an excuse not to raise interest rates , rising uncertainty on the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait for arguments , &quot; she said .
There is no consensus on the decision the Fed will take , with it itself causing instability in the financial market .
About half of economists recently questioned by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week .
But financial markets expect Fed Fed to delay , key indicator showing the likelihood of growth is just 30 per cent .
That would indicate a fall in the scholarship if Fed raises interest rate unless policymakers draw up policies would soften the blow by promising that they would pass a long time to the next increase .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 24.89 points , or 1.4 percent , to 16.599.85 .
Aviva was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers would keep rates stable this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; It would be surprising that the Fed raise its interest rate at the moment , &quot; Lonski said .
If Fed decision makers did so , &quot; they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets . &quot;
Other experts said an interest rate increase would calm financial markets down because it would remove uncertainty over when Fed action would act .
Just a month ago , Fed seemed poised to increase rates by 0.25 per cent this month , the first small step towards slower tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the force of US recovery .
Yellen said in the spring and earlier summer he expected an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by liberals such as needed more economic progress .
Although job creation slowed in August , growth of the labour market was solid this year .
Unemployment fell to 5.1 percent last month , the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the considered Fed level as total employment .
Wage Kashmir have shown signs of growth .
And although inflation continued not to reach central bank &apos;s annual target , Fed decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of plunging oil prices sharply .
The economy &quot; can cope with higher rates and needs them , given the strain on the labour market , &quot; Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macrooo , said .
But global financial markets began entering fiancée later this month after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16 percent below the record maximum reached in May as investors feared slowing Chinese economy would draw global growth down .
Market slipped somewhat this month , with the Dow index now about 10 percent below the maximum in May .
For Fed decision makers , buzz on the market adds to the complex calculation of timing interest rate hikes .
&quot; Without what has happened on financial markets and news about weakening the Chinese economy in recent weeks , it would be firmer in the sitting , &quot; said Stephen D. Oerner , experience researcher within UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official .
Now he expects at least a month to manage the effects better .
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what impact on the US economy will be and almost have no data they later rely on events in China , &quot; Oerner said .
Knitting the global economy is not one of Fed &apos;s major interests , so virtually no consideration should be considered in making decisions .
But in reality the Fed has become global monetary authority .
In recent years , the influence of the central bank has been huge .
Mere hint of then @-@ chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could &quot; narrow &quot; monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in world markets .
In a world where markets and savings are squeezed out more and more , Fed officials are not only expected to monitor progress in other areas but to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy .
His decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zachary Cowell , head of the global strategy department at Welfare Management firm Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , Federal Reserve Bank chairman in Richmond , Viti . , said this month that &quot; Fed has an overreacted historian to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to economic bases . &quot;
Lacker , a voting law member of the Federal Committee on Open Market , the decision @-@ making body , which backed interest rate hikes , provided the 1998 @-@ 99 decisions as an example .
A financial crisis that affected Asia prompted the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings , &quot; despite implications with limited identification possibility for US development , &quot; Lacker said .
A year later , Fed officials returned to those cuts .
EDF should put the issue of financial stability first place only in the event of a major crisis , such as the 2008 market earthquake , said Adam S. Posen , a former England Bank interest rate setting committee member .
The last troubled period falls far beyond that level , he said .
&quot; We certainly don &apos;t want to get to the situation of afraid of an interest rate increase because they have upset the markets , &quot; said Posen , president of Baron Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and , until something changes in this regard , I do not believe that premature action should be taken .

Seven &apos; s Sunshine dominates polls despite attempts by Channel Nine to broadcast to Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent movement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of consequences of changes from Liberal party leadership have not brought significant audience growth for Today .
Channel Nine &apos;s matecraft delivered from the capital after Tony Abbott &apos;s defeat to Malcolm Turnbull .
The Sunshine competition , moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was caught in London as part of a series of broadcast coverage over the course of several weeks , which included Dubai , New York , Casfall Niagara and Cancun .
This &quot; cruelty &quot; of the distance seemed to count too much for Aussie TV viewers , Sunshine having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities , compared to Today by 339,000 .
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday &apos;s hearing ( 3171,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283,000 ) but figures were lower than last Thursday ( 333,000 ) .
Today has lowered the gap to Sunshine in recent months .
In August , Today had an average audience of 31818,000 and Sunshine Coast 330,000 .
At the beginning of the year , the gap varies between 40,000 and 50,000 .
Deila , in September , Suns have an average audience of 339,000 viewers and Today 314,000 .
This is the most interesting thing that happened throughout the morning .
This morning , it is not just Parliament that is affected by the power of change !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for your question !

4 Killed After Police fired rubber bullets in Nepal protesters
Four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy boy , have been killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said Wednesday .
Violins happened Tuesday evening in the Shahandehi district , about 285km west of the Lib Dems .
According to Danielle Prasad Dhakal , the head of the district police , more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station , while some threw stones and Molotov cocktails .
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after firing in the air before resorting to using rubber bullets .
Twenty @-@ five police officers and five civilians were injured , according to him .
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets , believed to be able to kill but usually used as a less lethal alternative , caused so many deaths .
The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests held in Nepal &apos;s southern region , where members of the ethnic Madhesi group say the new provinces set up under the new constitution would dilute their political influence .
Protests have also existed in western Nepal , where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 policemen , were killed in violent clashes triggered on August 10th .
When four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces -- a major step towards a new constitution , however , a major step towards a new constitution , however , a highly controversial issue in Nepal , the country ruled centrally for hundreds of years .
The procedure for drawing up a new constitution was launched in 2008 , but legislators stepped up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April .

Weight reduction surgery could be helpful in diabetes case with easy obesity
Benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with easy obesity , with diabetes zaharat type 2 may maintain for at least five years , according to a new study .
It &apos;s still premature to say whether diabetes etic with easy obesity live longer after surgical intervention of loss in weight than those following non @-@ hirretrievable treatments .
&quot; Long needed to centralize mortality data , &quot; Dr Robin Blackstone , obesity surgery specialist , told an article about the new study in Julia Gillespie .
Surgery for weight loss , called and barrier surgery , uses diverse methods to lower the stomach .
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
Over the years , barrister surgery proved effective in treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies carried out people with morbidity obesity , with body mass index ( IMC ) 35 or higher .
IMC , a weight measure unit in the present report , is considered normal in the 18.5 @-@ 24.9 range .
IMC value of at least 25 indicates someone is overweight and people with IMC more than 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your standard accessory : 1,usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , researchers at Taiwan General Hospital Min @-@ Sheng used close data after 2007 in a genre in which two types of barbecue surgery compares - using gastric and gastware in Manson - in medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with easy obesity .
IMC Environmental Officer to People who suffered surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
Meanwhile , IMC to people who received non @-@ hirurgeon treatments against zaharat diabetes remained close to the same level , namely 29 .
Of those suffering surgical intervention , diabetic diabetes healed completely at 36 per cent and partly to 28 per cent .
In the treaty group through medical methods , by comparison , cosmetic diabetes has healed completely at just 1 % and partly to just 2 % of subjects .
In addition , controlling arteries tension , barley liceriders and LDL &quot; bad &quot; cholesterol cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the surgical group , &quot; the authors concluded .
Searchers have also monitored the health level of hemoglobph A1c reflecting the glickering level over time .
Commuters write that the optimal level of hemoglobacter A1c is below 7 per cent .
After surgical intervention , the average level of hemoglobacter A1c fell from around 9 percent to about 6 per cent .
But in the treaty group through medical methods , it kept up to around 8 % .
But this &quot; glicemic control &quot; improved - reflected by improved levels of hemoglobacter A1c - did not reduce mortality rates to five years , according to chief researcher Dr Chih @-@ Cheng Roberts and colleagues .
The research team also compared average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention .
In the fifth year compared to my group with Gastrectomie in Manson , the heart surgical intervention group lost more in weight ( 18.7 compared with 14.2 kg ) , there was stronger drops in IMC value ( 7.4 per 5.1 ) and hemoglobacter A1c ( 3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent ) and presented a higher probability of a complete remission of sugary diabetes ( 46.9 per cent from 16.7 per cent ) .
While the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study by sea weight in Sweden that surgical intervention extends life , Blackstone University , the Faculty of Medicine , says - Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , obese individuals who suffered surgical intervention barrier surgery showed up about 29 % less likely to die after 15 years compared to a group that sought more conventional methods .
While the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival at patients suffering surgical intervention , Blackstone said it was an upbeat aspect for people with IMC below 35 interested in procedure .
&quot; This is where this work is critical because it states that surgical intervention is safe in the lower IMC group , &quot; without raising risk of death or renaline disease , she says .
Blackstone added patients and their doctors should begin -take weight seriously then the patient &apos;s IMC reaches 27 @-@ 30 .
&quot; I think we &apos;re waiting too long until we urge people to take this matter seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they have accumulated these genetic modifications that shortened their circuits to predisplacing bodies to obesity and diabetes , it &apos;s extremely hard to return to normal .
&quot; It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not receive all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , adding that the real solution to the current situation of refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
The leader of the Tibetan Treasurer has sent an appeal to end violence in refugee mother countries .
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford dedicated to ethics studies during his 10 @-@ day visit to Britain .
He said that in the current situation , humanity &apos;s interests should prevail before each nation &apos;s interests and even every continent .
He also stressed that while admirable , the response from Western Europe countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate .
&quot; It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to face the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; It &apos;s great care for several thousand refugees , but we must also think about long @-@ term solutions to bring peace and sincere development , especially through education , in Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
Basically , we have to think about ways of reducing crimes in their countries .
We must reduce the use of force .
Force never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
Addressing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions following terrorist attacks on September 11th , calling the US violent response generated an uncontrollable events chain .
After the events of 11 September , we expressed condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without calling for violence .
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama said .
Four times increase in children who have ingested their own antidepressants over the past 4 years
Under Georgia &apos;s anti @-@ poisoning Centre , US anti @-@ poisoning centres have reported an increase of around 400 % since 2010 in terms of number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed up prosthetic tissue with high alcohol content .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of Georgia &apos;s anti @-@ poisoning Centre , cases of ingitis of child hands under 12 reported at anti @-@ poisoning centres climbed from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014 .
&quot; Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them arrive at the emergency room , &quot; Lopez told CNN .
Lopez said some children intentionally drink sweat and others do her to impress upon her friends to respond to challenges on social media .
Videos can be traced to YouTube showing teenagers how they drink potassium to create cheap drinks .
The teenager appears to have mixed the detergent with drinking water to get a more loud drink .
Smaller children can be attracted to the attractive smell of mosquitoes .
&quot; A child doesn &apos;t think she makes them bad , &quot; Lopez says .
Many of the most attractive types ( of handalyser ) are the perfume .
Toothpaste with strawberries , grapes , Orange are children &apos;s most attractive ones .
The handbag contains around 45 @-@ 95 per cent alcohol .
Especially at small children , only a few seasons can cause alcohol poisoning .
&quot; It &apos;s alcohol very focused , &quot; Dr Stephen Thornton , medical director at the University Hospital anti @-@ poisoning center in Kansas City Hospital , told Fox 4 in Kansas City .
So we avoid leaving a glass of turkey flowers on the table , but people leave these detergent detergent in affordable places and if small ones reach them , this is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
The six @-@ year @-@ old daughter Nhaijah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprints at school equivalent of hands with strawberries , arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment .
Had alcohol emiao 179 , twice the threshold to which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol , according to Dr. Chris Ritchey , doctor at the emergency room who treated her at Gwinett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
Nhaijah ballad ballad she couldn &apos;t go when she arrived at the emergency room .
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and struck head because of alcohol , Ritchey said .
&quot; It was terrifying , &quot; Ortoria Scott , Nhaijah &apos;s mother , told CNN .
It might have been fatal .
Lopez advised Parenans and teachers to use wetware or wet servings without alcohol and stop leaving their hands @-@ in @-@ hand logos at their fingertips .
In addition to alcohol poisoning , some detergents have been associated with deaths .
In 2013 , two Ontario women died after swallowed a hands @-@ induced coma containing a toxic , unreported ingredient .
Health authorities assumed the product contained metol , lethal substance , rather than alcohol , specified as an active ingredient .
In January , three fourth @-@ class students in north New York colluded with poisoning their teacher &quot; evil &quot; &quot; putting antibacterial products into class , &quot; according to a police report .
The teacher is very runner @-@ up to his hand @-@ induced coma and banned him in his classroom .
Police believed the plan was &quot; drunk &quot; and filed the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate .

Scots absence in title race saves Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because they don &apos;t beat for title with Rangers .
De Boer , currently ambassador for those at Ajax , said : &quot; In Holland I no longer cite the match @-@ match summary of those from Celtic ; why ? &quot;
Because they &apos;re not the Rangers there .
Here , it &apos;s not just talk about returning Rangers forward .
Talk about Fifm &apos;s plan .

We want to get out as quickly as possible from this situation .
I know it &apos;s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or trolling tied to what &apos;s going on .
We also feel ourselves - but we have to go further .
We necessarily need the support of Celtic because so and players get better .
It is extremely important that we remain united now .
Caution Warburton on January transfers
Despite the comments just weeks ago suggesting he had identified several goals for January transfers , Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary when it comes to transfers , insisting he doesn &apos;t want to affect the Ibrox team &apos;s unit .
Former Brentford boss said : &quot; January transfers period is very different than summer . &quot;
In the case of players transferred summer , there is the pre @-@ season period in which they can be integrated , something you could see this season in our group .
The team is doing very well .
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players who aren &apos;t needed .

Why I &apos;m witnessing execution in Oklahoma
Later today , except for a belated legal intervention , I shall look how one man is sentenced to death .
If it happens , and I hope not to happen , I will sit in a room for observers from the Oklahoma State prison execution hall and see how Richard Giffe is executed by administering lethal injections .
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
The invitation came first in January via his best friend , and although I was shocked , I accepted .
As the day is approaching , I am appalled by the idea .
The ASA that why do I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell everybody story about capital punishment .
It would provide a unique perspective .
True , journalists can witness executions in America and , because usually applications exceed the number of seats available , a macabre lottery occurs instead of deciding who will be elected .
Oklahoma have reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five .
Those elected will look at execution with impartiality .
I cannot do that .
I &apos;d sit next to Richard Gacquarie &apos;s closest friends , in addition I &apos;ve developed my own connection with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours a half hours .
Likes type .
Radem often much when we talk .
Prison authorities say they cannot be witness and journalist as well , so it will not allow me to have a carnett and a pix to score what they see .
I &apos;ll have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist in Oklahoma has accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality .
IATA the lesson .
She tells the story of the detainee as he wants , getting access .
I cried at her .
He admitted he &quot; could have formula better , &quot; but still feels wrong .
Richard Giffe disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote them .
I don &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t even do it if they asked me .
I told him he can remove me from the witness list whenever .
However , it wants an international report to write about the subject .
It believes that if he dies , advertising will help movement against capital punishment .
Kim Belller , reporter at Huffington Post , will be with me .
If you mean doing more about the case , listen to the multimedia file series we have made .
I won &apos;t come back here on all details .
I can &apos;t certainly say Richard Giffe is innocent .
His actions after Barry Van Treese murder are guilty of complicity .
But I think he &apos;s very likely not to be guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty .
I think his execution is wrong .
And I &apos;ll look him dying from that perspective .
I can &apos;t claim I &apos;m totally objective .
For that , you can read articles written by other reporters .
From me you &apos;ll find out how it &apos;s to watch a man you like dying unnecessarily .
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy against him and threatening to pull out of racing
Peter Moody said Queensland Racing Victoria chief attempted to infiltrate a spy at his graphies last year and threatened to immediately retire from racing .
It launched an attack against the Rebels and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , calling them running a personal campaign against him , the straw that filled out the glass as removing Lady Tatai in the race because of a treatment administered during race day .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for races and that he &apos;s put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome to Lidari &apos;s test for Broncos another for which he has no explanation .
For 18 months swallowed his words about statements about spies and didn &apos;t want to resemble &quot; foxpea that doesn &apos;t reach grapes . &quot;
&quot; I wasn &apos;t going to say anything connected to that aspect and I went silent long but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything bursts out suddenly , &quot; Moody said .
It &apos;s known he continued .
Sometimes react and you have to bear the consequences , and I will have to live with what I have said .
Disneyland will go home and sleep quietly .
I want to go head @-@ to @-@ head and want my owners working to see me strive to give me everything that &apos;s best .
Since they begin to believe that this is not the case , I must give up the living profession .
At that point I &apos;ll have to think about what I &apos;m going to do with my certification .
Earlier , Moody threw the bomb in an interview given for racing.com in which he said integrity department tried to spy graphies .
&quot; Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey , Dillon le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were queuing in a room alongside a guy - whose name I &apos;ll tell if I &apos;m asked - and offered to hire him to graphene to provide information about work there , &quot; Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he sees me as a cheat .
If so , then he should give all his resignation because they were incompetent in a bid to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former RVL president David Moodie , current chairman of RVL and Bernard Saundry , RVL &apos;s current CEO of CEO , knew at the time and they know today too .
Should I think it &apos;s something personal ?
Is it necessary that the RVL start having the backbone and can fire outsiders liable for what happens in industry ?
Do I have a bad influence on industry ?
So bad is my influence on industry ?
Maybe that &apos;s how others see it .
Maybe I have to take my licence and turn aside and I have no doubts that statements I do now might prompt him to think about this variant .
But I arrived at the point where I no longer care and that &apos;s what saddens me .
It saddens me very loud .
I &apos;ll put pressure on and make him make a decision .
My family supports me and they can walk away .
His frustration &apos;s frustration grew with the lengthy inquiry into testing at the little else where Lidari had been involved and the removal prompted him to assert that he might &quot; get his licence on the table . &quot;
Moody , whose name is most commonly associated with training undefeated Australian champions Black Caviar , labelled the treatment rule on race day as &quot; ridiculous &quot; after applying to horses &apos; feet a pupil with namesol or argas , breaking the rules .
It tramples on flights .
I have to take my full responsibility for that , &quot; he says .
One of my employees put them out of their mistake nameless on leg .
It might have happened last night .
It might have happened yesterday , which happened .
It happened on race day .
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on race day consisting of the application of puppies , for which stewards have opened an investigation .
It &apos;s a joke .
People making these rules know nothing about horses .
&quot; We all understand that rules are needed , but too far has gone on , &quot; Moody said .

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in battle charges .
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism levelled against the placenta used by his team as &quot; distorted subjects &quot; brought into question by the NRL &apos;s top two favourites .
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm players to &quot; take them to the throne &quot; team in their winning nervous storm match in Sydney &apos;s final qualifying final Friday evening .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight mention of Storm after his team &apos;s victory in the qualification match with North Queensland and Cowboys played Saturday evening when he called rugby league &apos;s &quot; demonstration &quot; of rugby league and said the two teams in Queensland rugby league were not too much about wrestling .
Bellamy jumped to defence touchdown touchdown approached by his team and said players focused simply on &quot; contact &quot; when placenta .
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two senior coaches blasted her team , meaning they were Incare that Storm would beat them out .
&quot; And things don &apos;t stop there - I didn &apos;t hear Trent Robinson complain about the ruck when they beat us with the score 24 @-@ 2 , &quot; Bellamy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques , so only in the last six weeks we have really placed emphasis on contact in placenta and thus have changed the situation .
Trent is in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he probably isn &apos;t used to losing and he was a filthy for him .
Nosus how it always happens during this period of year .
Bellamy contradicted Bennett &apos;s idea of &quot; Anima Football , &quot; recalling his mentors St George @-@ Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing football &quot; boring . &quot;
Wayne talks about thrilling football .
It argued his comparison of Saturday evening &apos;s game with our game Friday evening and talked about how thrilling the game was , &quot; Bellamy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George received a lot of criticism because he was a dull team and Wayne said he didn &apos;t interest him as black under the line either .
But now he has a team that can play what we see as thrilling football , especially thanks to fast youth midfielders .
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players .
He brought this argument back in 2010 , now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not any team has two midfielders as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that .
Ml gives me more confidence because they say these things because I &apos;m somewhat impervious to match with us .
Six weeks ago probably didn &apos;t think about us when they were thinking about key matches .
Bellamy also singled out that the Storm vs Roosters match was a sharper outfit tied to score compared to the Broncos and Cowboys match .
The Broncos match was probably a good match , we didn &apos;t see him yet , how was the score 16 @-@ 12 ?
Our match finished 20 @-@ 18 , in our game there were two tries , that means thrilling game time ?
Or thrilling mean doing breaks and not kidding ?
Plans for me are planned .
If I talk about us , it means at some point we could meet them .
Storm is free this weekend because they have won the right to play at home either with North Queensland or Cronulla Sharks at AAMI Park final Saturday at AAMI Park , with tickets putting on sale starting Tuesday next Tuesday .
Stevan Hogg used mobile fetify to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to call for images of abused children .
Stevan Hogg took the groomphone phone when she was then asleep and pulled out liver in an online messaging service where another user sent him a series of indecent images having children as a subject .
The girl later woke up and noticed the phone &apos;s disappearance , which he found in Hogg &apos;s hand while he was asleep .
He looked at her phone and found disturbing messages after immediately alerting her mother .
After finishing , police saw the five pictures then looked at computers found at the address and found &quot; disturbing &quot; searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of some children .
Hogg pretended to have done it to &quot; attract pedophile pedophile &quot; on the Internet before &quot; claiming a policeman to scare them . &quot;
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee court : &quot; He said he was an addiction - that he was addicted to scared people .
Admitted he had made searches on his computer but said she did because he wanted to be shown as a policeman to scare paedophiles .
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent her pictures and about asking those person to stop sending them and other pictures .
He said she did it to lure them .
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he is drinking and wants to see footage of rapes and murders .
Mr Robertson added : &apos; When the little girl found the messages on the phone , shouted her mother and hate her and crying .
Shirta saw indecent images on the phone and the accused faced .
Shirta was interviewing and told her she used her computer and keyboard accused to speak to girls who seemed much younger than him .
Last year , on 14 June , 23 @-@ year @-@ old Hogg , enrolled in Ward Road , Dundee , pleaded guilty to allegations he had realized or made indecent pictures of sexist children , and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before court at his appearance on March 24 this year .
Defense attorney Gregor Sim called for Hogg not registered on the sex offenders register because he can claim offence &quot; did not involve significant sexual aspect . &quot;
Judge Alistair Carmichael adjourned the ruling until October , for reasons of social reports .
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody prior to indecent assault for other files .
He was passed on sex offenders &apos; register before being given the sentence .
Robert Mugabe , president of Zimbabwe , delivered wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year , Mr Mugabe , the oldest African leader , fell on the steps of a podium .
But no injuries were hurt but the fall video became viral on social networking sites .
Opening the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed they had received anonymous death threats , threatening to pardon Mr Mugabe during his speech .
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - speech he repeated Tuesday .
The head of Turkey &apos;s parliamentary group for Democratic Elections ( CDM ) , Innocent Gonese , said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones , warned not to disrupt Mr Mugabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; The message was sent by a hidden number but was titled &quot; Death , &quot; he told journalists after Mr Mugabe &apos;s speech .
II warns MPs concerned that immunity only applies to Parliament and once they leave Parliament , parliamentary immunity is no longer value .
The MP group head said the party , led by Morgan Kamberi , is &quot; concerned &quot; about threats sent to politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard to make 30,000 layoffs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of restructuring company efforts and cost reduction in the service sector .
This year HP will split on the stock exchange in two societies , dividing up computer division and printers from operations with corporate hardware and rising services .
Disney projected upgrades will bring about $ 2.7 billion costs costs from the fourth quarter , HP said .
&quot; These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure in terms of costs , &quot; said Meg Whitman , chairman and chief executive HP , who will lead the unit after the split .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help transition businesses to their new style of business progress , &quot; Whitman said .
Sworn as a separate company , we are positioned better than ever to meet growing demands of our global customers .
Under a company statement , Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $ 50 billion and &quot; focus on providing integrated without rival solutions &quot; to companies .
It is replicated a company founded in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University , Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , given an object of activity by electrical equipment production and whose garage in Palo Alto has been dubbed the &quot; Silicon Valley cradle . &quot;
HP has undergone massive reorganisation to adapt to switching from traditional computers to mobile devices .
The move taken HP , the world &apos;s second largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the US , is the latest in the field , relying on the idea that firms focusing their attention better in one direction have a better performance .
KingsFest : Comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar personation in the series is obvious , given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever , suicide rates among young men reaching the top of 15 years .
In 2013 , suicide posed the main cause of death to men aged 20 @-@ 45 , and remains three times more frequent in men than women .
In a bid to address the problem , Campania Against unfortunate Life ( Lib Dems ) named 2015 as the Year of Barrier , keen to question culture which prevents men from seeking help when they need .
Friendship sits at the heart of the fight to succeed in this challenge .
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students showing depression symptoms concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends &quot; with healthy mood , &quot; her chances for recovery doubles .
To the same extent , for people who aren &apos;t depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces half likelihood of mental disorder appearance .
Of course , for friendship to have effect , it must first be accessible .
In this era of communication dominated by social media , where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance , the immediate nature of the response often has priority before contact with meaning .
Our digital soundtrack has doubled the need to create the apparent to powerful personality , open to fun and success , even if it &apos;s actually isolation in reality that dominates .
This shallow success is dominated by what psychologists call extrfrost values ; money , image , social status , all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which seriously affects our mental health .
Billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really does not buy happiness .
Beauty of the Friends series was that he directed the idea .
The characters were not defined by the job but of his own personality , which they showed by interacting as friends .
Wicketkeeper Joey and Chandler &apos;s frequent moments , the moments when he looks at football in the formative seats and Ross &apos;s passion for Rachel came from being known that men can associate themselves with this situation , even if they often ferrying themselves to fully explore their feelings .
ASA how explained a social worker : &quot; ... my role to listen to people with the tendency of suicide and depressed showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference . &quot;
Often , people turning to us don &apos;t feel able to speak to friends .
The old adage to do yourself is strong , as does the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems .
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to give more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long run .
The series highlighted small moments of friendship between men .
Worn by long helps objective intervention , outside , via phone , people get in moments of despair , long @-@ term prop comes from family and close friends .
So if you attend this weekend &apos;s weekend at FoxsFest organized by Central Aberdeen , with complete restoration of the shoot @-@ up platter to celebrate the event , why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you see someone alone in Starbucks , smile and welcome .
It &apos;s never known what difference your friendship might do .
Friends airs on Central Aberdeen Central from start to final - all 236 episodes - at # FoxsFest
Di Maria Marks and helps PSG set aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo .
Angel Di Maria marked Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League match and helped PSG assert himself against Swedish team Malmo .
Next we bring chronic present to the match and reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have teamed up with their duty , Paris Saint @-@ Germain starting the match series in Champions League groups , with a refreshing 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmo in their match Tuesday on Parc des Prisoner .
Di Maria marked in less than four minutes since the start of his Test match in the PSG team , bringing champions France in advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the Cavani goal scored in the 61st minute .
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetk , Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the French team goal is not just qualification in the bullpen but also an improvement in the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments .
But while they took the points , Laurent Blanc &apos;s students were far from a perfect picture , with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasted the opportunity of goal after being replaced by the team in his hometown and club to which his brilliant career began in 1999 .
&quot; It &apos;s not easy to win at home or travelling in the Champions League so victory by 2 @-@ 0 creates problems with our opponents and sets a comfortable difference to the next batters , even though there are points you have to refine throughout the season , &quot; Blanc says .
It &apos;s a good sign .
We wanted to win and we did it , although I am sorry we weren &apos;t able to give one or two goals .
Ibrahimovic returned after injury to one of three changes to the Paris team , with a 2 @-@ 2 replay coming home from Bordeaux in League 1 at the weekend , but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute .
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United , Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man to lead PSG to the next level in Europe and showed that when he tasered to Marco Verratti &apos;s care behind Malmo &apos;s defence before incredible sweat over Johan Wilding , in the long corner on right Gate .
But if someone was expecting PSG to get victory over their fingers at their fingers , they were disappointed .
Malmo , who beat Celtic in play @-@ off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine shots at national teams , with a defence from five people and two defensively defensive midfielders , was a strong contender .
But their attack wasn &apos;t impressive , with the exception making Nikola Pendjic &apos;s sauce who passed away from Kevin Trump &apos;s post in the 34th minute .
Instead , PSG players slowed the pace a few times , giving several unnecessary passes and uncompleting the interventions , even Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five tries just in the first half and then replaced Cavani just after the game resumed .
Ibrahimovic proved much more skilful in supporting his colleagues , however , he cares about being the one that Di Maria sent in a deviant nose by Wilmingfish in the 52nd minute .
The second goal was scored in a finish after leaking an hour of the match thanks to Cavani , uruguayer who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic cared from Maxwell &apos;s centrifuges .
That goal removed the hope of Malmo that they would rebalance the score and just a superb bowler by Wilding Wilding from the distance for rejecting David Luiz kept his final score before newly intruder Ezequiel Lavezzi overturned a goal in stoppage time .
Malmo &apos;s Norwegian coach in Malmo , Age Hareide , later said PSG were with a class fish and that &quot; the last match we played in the Champions League was December last year . &quot;
Since then , I have only played in Sweden &apos;s league that doesn &apos;t match up to the same level .
Caliphate isn &apos;t enough .
Netherlands slaps for PSG .
They did an excellent game .

Air India Air Force packs around 130 calories per day and spacecraft frequent because they &apos;re overweight , the company announced late last week .
The state company announced the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations , but critics say the move was &quot; ridiculous &quot; and &quot; shockingly sleaking , &quot; writes The Washington Post .
Mass firing is the latest in a ten @-@ year battle between the company and steals less placid .
The weight limit for them dates back to the 1980s when Air India began using graphic graphics with weight and faces ideal .
In 2006 Air India fired nine frequent centrifuges as &quot; exceptionally overweight , &quot; as this &quot; can have an effect on the reflex and can prevent the necessary agility needed to carry out emergency measures . &quot;
Steenkamp gave the company sue , won and were rehired , but the company fired them again in 2009 .
&quot; Every effort to make them weaken failed , &quot; then a company spokesman explains then .

PSD acting President Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that all the party wants to remain in government and , if the prime minister wants to , the PSD Congress will formalise his decision .

What happens to me when I was selecting er , it was not normal , I was not respected , do not respect my work .
I worked well with the pre @-@ Federation of Federation , but when Burleanu came to Federation came up with a predesigned idea , he didn &apos;t know me , find different views from the press about me .
It hasn &apos;t changed me because it was very hard at that point , with the results we had , plus that it was the financial situation in the middle .
I continued work , everything went very well and probably changed his ideas too .
But I wanted to leave .
If I really want to stay , I then proposed them an increase in contract .
We have around 400 and something thousands of euros per year , I was going to have around EUR 600 thousand .
I didn &apos;t talk to Burleanu , but with his right hand .
&quot; It agreed , but only if we finish first in the group , &quot; Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport .

TVR leadership activity report rejected in committees : Stelian Tanase risking dismissal
Parliament &apos;s culture committees rejected a report by the administration of the Romanian Television Society Administration Board of Directors on Wednesday .
To reject the report voted 17 lawmakers , one against rejection ( Senator Varujan Vosganian ) and one abstained .
The text of the report will be submitted to the permanent assembled offices .
They will decide , probably next week .
The next convener will be debated .
&quot; I think considering this situation will be made relatively quickly , &quot; said Senate culture Committee Chairman Georgica Severin .
He added that &quot; it was of good sense &quot; for TVR management to be present at this sitting , while at the meeting of Culture Committees , no representative of the TVR leadership was present .
It was of good sense to be the presence of TVR leadership because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like this .
The invitation was made to CA members since last night , with an approximate hour that I didn &apos;t know any new hour , but today , after the Happy Birth sitting , personally I sent a fax to the patriarchal leadership inviting her .
I think when Esti summoned , you have budget controllers , paid out of public fees and Esti summoned to a committee sitting together even if you don &apos;t like nerves .
&quot; Because it is your duty of service , Esti in an institution in charge of Parliament , &quot; Severin said after sitting with Parliament &apos;s assembled Culture Committees .
He added that financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the sitting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees .
Debt we saw and as they continued , came up with the idea that this year it would have been a day but didn &apos;t pay out of historic ones .
&quot; Remind you that not from my fault or someone else in these committees has lost that leisure with the banks and the taxman , there are clear management problems , &quot; Severin said .
He added that after the work report was rejected by the plenary session , elections will follow for a new Board of Directors , and he will elect the institution &apos;s director general .
I do not know who will be proposed for this position .
Miracles won &apos;t be done .
It is important to make political decisions so that this institution works .
I &apos;m not the man to lie , tell you that a genius will emerge who will sit up here and beat himself .
I hope those who decide , plenary of Parliament , through their vote will make a lot of sense for people who will lead TVR .
They have to be people who know what &apos;s going on there , have experience and have much fairness and respect for the institution and tradition .
I do not know who will be , if you wonder what qualities they have to have - good sense in attitude towards employees because it is a malware that comes from employees , complaints , redundancies .
&quot; When you get such complaints 50 , 60 , 70 , something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation which is a disaster , &quot; the president of the Senate culture committee concluded .
Although he did not appear in Parliament , TVR TVR Vice President General Stelian Tanase sent a letter to Chamber of Deputies President Valeriu Zgonea asking for parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and ensuring economic and political independence for public television , including indexing TV tax .
In the letter , Stelian Tanase asks , in addition to indexing TV tax , altering and complementing 878 / 2003 on tax on public service broadcasting , in the sense of updating provisions on technology changes to day as well as regulating the procedure relating to the level of payment of technology tax to day as well as for regulating the procedure for paying tax tax breaks and finding offences and enforcing sanctions and penalties .
He also wants to release a provision providing for extending the requirement for all electricity providers to become members of SRTv to collect TV tax , via ANRE involvement in regulating this activity .
In his view , there is a need to establish a 5 % maximisation ceiling of the ticket from the proceeds .
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for activities specific to the public broadcaster and contribution for CNC from 15 per cent to 3 per cent , but also altering law 41 / 1994 , in terms of the possibility of receiving budget allowances / funding for acquiring licences for major cultural and sporting events - the World Football Championship , Golden Cerase , Eurovision .
He claims SRTv will default in the coming months considering Labour legislation obliges your employer to implement court rulings , even if they are not definitive and wage rights are facing priority over any other obligation .
The TVR administration has consistently made efforts to reduce spending on TV staff and production .
&quot; So journeys and other cost @-@ generating activities have been reduced , a number of trade contracts have been renegotiated and a number of trade contracts have been renegotiated , and at the end of July the TVR Evening News has been closed , &quot; said TVR President TVR &apos;s letter .
Tanase appreciates that disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only through their efforts .
&quot; Without support from the state institutions -- the government , Parliament , presidency -- Romanian Television will be , sooner or later , unable to fulfil its public mission , &quot; the letter reads .
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee of Culture .
Gynecologist Vasile Blaga sent to trial
Vasile Blaga &apos;s gynecologist , Ionut Andrei Rudeanu , was sent to trial Wednesday by the Bucharest Court of Appeal prosecutors .
He faces charges of tax evasion , in a file of damages of about 60mph , under judicial scrutiny .
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested defensively on May 22 .
He set up the Lib Dem watchdog SRL alongside his mother in April 2009 a year after marrying Vasile Blaga &apos;s daughter Agathe .
It emerged from the investigation that , with the aim of circumventing taxes and taxes to the state budget , representatives of a specialist company in guarding services would have created a crime circuit consisting of several commercial companies , whereby fictitious transactions would have been highlighted .
&quot; In fact , in accounting for the company , fictitious service purchases would have been registered , which , in reality , were not provided , with the state budget costing around 600,000 euros , &quot; Romanian Police explained in a press release .
Seics set up Sanmarsh fate
Seics of the Al @-@ Ittihad club have set the fate of Lucian Sanmarinas .
Although Arabic media announce that Sanmarya &apos;s breakaway from Ittihad e imminent , billionaire coaches Ladislau Boloni , Arcadie Zatriojanu , says this will no longer happen again .
Boloni is very happy with Sanmarsh .
Lucian plays a match match and doing well .
Seaty also realised that he was the best and would be wrong if your forehand to him .
It would have been a variant to bring another player , much better off but nothing came out .
&quot; There were more discussions like that with Mombk Boussoufa , but nothing materialised , &quot; Zerrojanu told Breaking Sport .
Lucian Sanmarinas reached Al @-@ Ittihad earlier this year .
Ilie Sârbu voted vice @-@ president at the Court of Auditors
Parliament &apos;s plenary voted Wednesday to appoint PSD senators Ilie Sârbu , Prime Minister Victor Ponta &apos;s herd , as vice president of the Court of Audit at the Court of Auditors .
According to Mediafax , 290 votes were registered &quot; for &quot; and 108 &quot; against . &quot; According to Mediafax .
The vote was secret , with ballots .
PNL representatives were alone in voting against the proposal , reports Digi24 .
Otherwise , liberals criticised Sârbu &apos;s appointment in this position and announced they would challenge him at the LNP when he has a file at DNA , but does not have the necessary preparation and experience .
Ilie Sârbu has 30 days to resign , under the law , to resign his Senate , because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to make politics any longer .
The PSD senator will serve as vice president of the Court of Auditors &apos; vice @-@ president of Auditors , left free after John Anton was revoked , following a September 2014 Constitutional Court decision which found him unconstitutional .
Surprise from one of sexy actors : I grew up in the kitchen
How Bradley Cooper is set to play the role of a chef in the film &quot; Burnt , &quot; the actor made a revelation that his fantasies didn &apos;t expect .
In a recent interview he said he grew up more in the kitchen : &quot; I worked much of his life as a chef . &quot;
He revealed he has worked in the kitchen since 15 years ago when she worked for a Greek restaurant , for then in college to continue along the same path .
The actor explained that her mother has Italian origins , so her entire childhood cooking with her Italian grandmother , reports ConcuttMusic .
Intrigued what plans to have had during that period , Bradley Cooper said never was the type of man to make plans over five years , &quot; not even two . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s nothing motivating for me to have a map , &quot; he said .
&quot; I have dreams , things you would laugh about if I told you , &quot; he said , saying that what he wanted from childhood turned out .
But reached at the age of 40 , the actor acknowledged , however , that he saw himself in the near future directorship , taking Clint Eastwood &apos;s model , who had been racing to regains everything at this age .
Ponta charged with uncontrolled slapping and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned Wednesday morning , Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta &apos;s claims that political decision makers in Hungary were &quot; really better than those in Syria , Libya or other countries fleeing refugees . &quot;
&quot; Yesterday Victor Ponta lost self @-@ control and , through his irrational claims , offence is the entire Hungary , &quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister conveyed in a release .
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slams .
&quot; His remarks have one explanation : He totally lost support in Romania &apos;s domestic politics , &quot; added the Hungarian diplomacy chief , according to MTI .
In a posting Tuesday evening on Facebook , Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior Hungarian government officials , who in his view &quot; are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union . &quot;
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian governmental representatives .
&quot; They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union ; and in anti @-@ Semitic attitudes , and in terms of treatment of minorities of all kinds , and now during the refugee crisis ! &quot; Ponta said on Facebook .
The Romanian prime minister added that he is advocating rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis , praising that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem .
Barbed wire , aggressive laws , prisons and safety brutality will not solve the problem - only will show that in Hungary , in the heart of Europe , in the heart of Europe , political decision makers are political decision @-@ makers with nothing better than those in Syria , Libya or other countries fleeing refugees !
&quot; I believe in solidarity , in rational and sustainable solutions , and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is completely contradiction precisely with these goals and values ! &quot; Underlined the head of the Romanian executive .
Earlier on Tuesday , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described &quot; mere lies &quot; in remarks by Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Hungary &apos;s handling of the refugee crisis , praising those claims inappropriate for a 21st century leader , according to MTI .
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also noted Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister &apos;s &quot; extremist and misleading remarks &quot; of Romania &apos;s domestic political crisis hold Romania &apos;s domestic political crisis and indicated that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side .
Szijjarto referred to a statement by Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Monday .
What I said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches that I am closing borders , that everyone who comes are terrorists , are nonsense of the Middle Ages and totally oppose this approach .
If we can get more , we can get it , the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as people , not how they treat our Hungarian neighbours , with Bata and insert .
&quot; With that I disagree , &quot; said the head of the Romanian executive , at a press conference in BuzzJiu .
Also Tuesday , Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest Government decided to begin preparations on the ground for extending its border fence with Romania to Romania , in order to deal with possible changes to the route used by migrants .
Afterwards , Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary &apos;s decision to erect a fence at borders solves nothing on the refugee issue and &quot; takes Hungary out of Europe . &quot;
What link exists between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of Mecca &apos;s cranes
Saudi authorities announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group , belonging to Osama bin Laden &apos;s family , is &quot; partly responsible &quot; for the collapse of a shell , Friday , in the Great Mosque of Mecca , accident following which 107 people have died .
According to an investigation panel , the company had &quot; not complied with safety norms , &quot; the Saudi news agency ( SPA ) reported , reports the BBC .
Company executives have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation is completed in this case .
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts .
Construction firm is owned by the family of former leader of the terrorist network Al @-@ Qaida terrorist network Osama bin Laden .
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden &apos;s father 80 years ago and is currently headed by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr .
Binnier Group has been working for 4 years on extending Greater Moskeys to potentially hosting more pilgrims .
The accident happened Friday evening during a storm when a machete , probably lopsided by strong wind gusts , crashed onto the eastern side of the Great Moskeys &apos; roof at Mecca .
Following the crash , 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured .
How Hagel closed his mouth challenged
Considered by a lot of world the world &apos;s biggest football player in history , Gica Hagi has been labelled , after retiring from work , as a weak coach , who cannot be able to perform in the new posture as well .
After unfortunate experiences to national team , Star or Galatasaray , Hagel took over , a year ago , the coaching role in the Future of Constanta , the team they charge .
After fixed a year after the team took over , King showed he was able to convert a team what zipped to save from relegation in one of the top .
So after a year of days the Future recorded , with Hagger coaching 16 wins , 11 rebounds and 11 defeats .
Bilsten is one of a top team , knocking himself at European ovens .
Things have taken even better turn for the Future this season as the team reached second in League 1 with 19 points , one less than leader Astra Giurgiu .
The future has and best attacking in League 1 , with 20 goals ( par par with Astra ) , more than double than Star Wars .
On the other hand , even though he brought to the team several experienced players , Hagel continued the policy of promoting young people , and lately in the starting team appeared names like Ianis Hagger or Hodorogea .
The club &apos;s policy has made the Future a team of watch for teams abroad , so Hagi sold 1.5m euros this summer -- Ianis Hagi ( Fiorentina - 1 million euros ) and Alexander Mitrita ( Bari - 500 thousand euros ) .
Along with Star Wars , the Future is the only profitable team in League 1 according to Trade Register data .
In refugee crisis Romania has so far played as a small country .
It is a legitimate strategy , but afterwards you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh EU country .
Large countries come with solutions for the entire EU , says Cristian Ghezic , a member of the college director of the Romanian Centre for European Policy College .
In an interview with Zizon.com , Cristian Ghilan showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress , and the purely police means will not function in this crisis : &quot; Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come from . &quot;
But they &apos;re the masses who embarked upon and we cannot return history .
Migration is a reality we need to adapt to as best we can and adapt them to us .
In Cristian Ghea &apos;s view , we are at an extremely emotional moment where politicians feel the need to show their muscles .
After he passes , Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement , but the rules within the Schengen area must be changed : &apos; Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation of now &apos; .
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA board which actually did nothing ?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the council .
All predictions were saying they had the necessary votes .
Before the Treaty of Lisbon , the principle of unanimity applies in JHA and any state could block any decision .
This is why things have been very little integrated into justice and home affairs .
After Lisbon , the normal procedure applies , in which the EC has the initiative , and the council approves it with the vote of 55 % of states , namely 16 , representing 65 % of the EU population .
Calculations said the votes existed .
But they didn &apos;t want to go ahead .
Because it is a sensitive issue , rejection reactions even appeared in Germany itself against Chancellor Merkel &apos;s opening policy and did not want in many countries to appear that an EU @-@ type reaction sends us migrants per head . &quot;
They have therefore postponed , but the problem remains because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and we are likely to see great changes there in the coming period .
So mandatory quotas were not really discarded but the subject was only left to racially ill ?
Yes , on the other hand , there is talk of greater involvement by Frontex in managing external borders , which means changing from individual responsibility for members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies .
Greece &apos;s border with Turkey is also Germany &apos;s de facto border with Turkey , and this wave of migrants has given limits to the old Schengen system .
Perhaps Dublin will be dropped , according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they enter the first time , because it is unsustainable .
If Greece cashing in , you cannot endlessly say that it is Greece &apos;s job .
The problem is common .
Precisely because the problem is common , is it possible to solve it without a precise , perhaps binding mechanism for sharing the effort received ?
Nobody knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work , if binding quotas will be reached .
Because it remains a problem : What do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal , but in Sweden or Germany ?
I do not believe that European countries will turn up to take migrants above : You bump into our X or country Y.
It is likely to reach unique filtering centres , in Greece or Turkey , where asylum applications can be applied .
Solutions like this are working on .
But the problem has no simple solution .
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants , they are countries without any experience , as Romania , where the migrant problem will increase xenophobic power .
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey , in Lebanon , in Jordan , in Jordan , who sit in precarious camps and have barely started leaving for Europe .
One estimate says only 10 % went on , winter is heavy on the Mediterranean , but we expect a perhaps even greater wave next year .
What do we do with people ?
Pronoshope is that we &apos;ll get used to this problem , we &apos;re not going to look so catastrophic in media terms .
Vanishing countries with less or higher experience .
Does it seem to me that there is any place where the integration of large groups from a European extrapolation culture really managed ?
I look at magrease bians in France , Turks in Germany , they &apos;re increasingly adept .
I wouldn &apos;t go towards radical statements .
Sure , their integration is harder than in case of other waves of Migration , but that does not mean they do not integrate at all .
It remained an unintegrated side which creates major social problems in France , Germany , in Britain .
But pure means will not work .
Let us create Europe &apos;s stronghold of wishful thinking .
We must humiliate ourselves to the integration mechanisms in European societies .
Here were mistakes .
We have to be more pretentious .
Let these people learn the language , seek to take up their values , stop staying with one leg in Europe and one in their home country , bringing the rest of the family including through convenience marriages .
However , the imminent problem of these people on the long @-@ term issue of their integration must be separated .
If others failed in long @-@ term integration it does not mean that we must look at them how they are drowning in the Mediterranean .
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come from .
And if it &apos;s going to be intervention in Syria , what I don &apos;t think , does not mean that it will restore your country overnight and you can take them back .
Until solutions arise , we see Fortress within Europe .
Borders have been closed , walls rise , border controls are introduced within the Schengen area .
Is the European project in danger ?
The European project as such is not , Schengen as built , yes .
It was built quite minimal and arrange the rules so pressure was too high on countries where they put their foot for the first time these migrants .
That is , we are moving freely by Colo Colo , but every e with his problems .
Faced with such an tide cannot happen , because some countries do not cope .
When there is such waves of emotion , politicians want to show they do something , but in the long run it doesn &apos;t change much .
After the attacks in France we do not have much more draconian anti @-@ terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year .
It is a wave of public emotion relocating .
And it &apos;s so fluid from week to week to another that you can &apos;t make decisions based on them .
We have a lot of chatter , many bellicular statements from politicians sitting at home under pressure from being viruses .
And then you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and public opinion moves away .
Once public emotion goes through , we will return to the reasons why we created this space , this freedom of movement that is not just for people , but also for goods .
This is the real European market .
And I don &apos;t think Europeans will give up this principle of inaction .
That there will be other rules .
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation now .
Romania how has he played so far in this crisis ?
Like a small country , who thinks that if you shoot swords like an eye and blows their ears , the theme disappears .
Faced with the reality of wave of migrants , you can choose to be part of the solution or god that it is not your small country problem .
That is what we have done , it is a legitimate strategy , but afterwards you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh EU country .
Don &apos;t Eknow , you don &apos;t play at home level .
Large countries come with solutions for all of the EU , good or bad , do not now discuss their quality .
The SAA how Poland did .
On the other hand , the effect of this crisis is that the Romanian appetite for Schengen will decrease greatly .
President Ethannis says it can be good that we have not already entered .
So we move from despair to entering a more pragmatic position , but the target remains .
There is , of course , a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen for migrants to see us as an alternative route .
Which does not mean that there is reason not to enter Schengen , but to be more pragmatic .
Romania will be part of Schengen , and Schengen will be part of Schengen , and Schengen will exist , but made in the sense where external borders will become joint responsibility , will be unique rules for accepting migrants , unique deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum , unique rules for countries deemed safe .
Ukrainian President said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died .
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks , a Russian play ?
Russia has frustrated power behaviour .
She believes that being great strength means getting Americans and Europeans alike .
From that point of view , yes , there &apos;s a connection .
Without the Putin regime &apos;s military and financial effort , the Assad regime probably would have collapsed long ago .
And it was good to crash before his main opponent was Islamic State .
Any two years has been a fight between Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias backed by Gulf and Western countries .
Then there was Islamic State and now we no longer know if we want the Assad regime to fall .
Russia was able to complicate matters but cannot participate in the solution .
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot close .
But Esti great power only if you have and solutions .
Playing off @-@ Side is just a strategy to win time .
Putin probably expects bids , apps him on buttons to fix the situation .
Bids do not come because the world is not convinced he can somehow solve the issues created by him .
But I don &apos;t agree with theories that say these people are manually eaten by an invisible hand .
Let &apos;s not see Putin stronger than he is .
What button you &apos;ll soon appear
Millions of Facebook users used the &quot; blue &quot; button , and now representatives of social networking are preparing another opposite , the &quot; Disney . &quot;
On Tuesday , Mark Zuckerberg , co @-@ founder and chief executive of the company , announced on his account that this button will soon be available , the New York Times reports on blog .
Zuckerberg made it clear that the &quot; Disney &quot; button would rather show a nut of what feels a user than just a simple option .
However , his announcement raised the issue that Facebook might become a less friendly place .
Zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid moments where someone posts on his account an important life event , and someone else will da &quot; Disney . &quot;
Network users , who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts , have long demanded having the opportunity to express negative emotions or empathy with something sad .
Mark Zuckerberg also said he was not very comfortable with people giving &quot; evidence &quot; to current events such as refugee crisis , or in case of a family member &apos;s death .
&quot; You can &apos;t feel comfortable giving the weight of that post , &quot; the Facebook representative noted .
The variant of a new Facebook button has not been met well by everyone .
&quot; There &apos;s already enough hate on Facebook and social networking sites , &quot; commented Amandan Haneef of Afghanistan , on Afghanistan &apos;s Facebook page , where article on the topic was posted .
&quot; I &apos;m going to give &apos; Disney &apos; buttons of &apos; Disney &apos; , &apos; he said .
Roger Anderson , an Atlanta microbiologist , claimed there was nothing wrong with this button , encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook .
Debra Aho Williamson , a social media analyst at eMarketer , noted it &apos;s hard to imagine a single button can convey a complex array of negative emotions .
Furthermore , she claims , the election campaign is approaching in America , and the &quot; Disney &quot; button would create a total disaster .
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary within 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday , a handful of thousands of arrivals en masse at its southern border with Serbia , government adviser Gyia Bakondi announced .
Hungary declared an emergency state of emergency during the day in two counties along its border with Serbia because of the refugee flow , closing a main border crossing and announcing it would build a fence at its border with Romania , the DPA recalls .
The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia .
Just yesterday they said they &apos;d show the border for those who want to pass , but not for those wanting to seek asylum .
&quot; As you see , this is totally different , &quot; Serbian refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin said .
Before imposing new immigration legislation , a record 5,434 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday , police announced Monday .
More than 175,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa have also hacked into Hungary from Serbia in 2015 .
Many avoid being registered and trying to get to the West , particularly Germany .
&quot; The New &quot; County Council seat sits to pink .
Two builders , in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years , with a view to moving the institution forward , sit down because they have stopped many times .
Two major builders who worked here stormed into insolvency during work .
County Council headquarters in the street Vasile Alecsandri will end up dropping himself .
A year and a half since building consolidation and reauthorization work should have been completed , work has not reached half .
One final stage in The Hunter Building had consumed past days when the National Council of Contesters ( CNSC ) rejected a complaint by the firm failing to take over the contract to carry out the technical project for works that were still to be executed .
The original draft was drawn up by Impex Rompupel SA .
Following the builder &apos;s insolvency and discontinued work , negotiations started without publication of an announcement announcement with Impex Rompupel , with the firm expected to update its technical project , and then organise a new tender for works .
&quot; However , negotiations have not completed through a contract , with CJ welcoming that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution , &quot; summarised Razvan Certhal , represented public relations within CJ .
CJ &apos;s decision to break direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Rompupel .
The ACT court sent the complaint to the CNSC , which rejected it as belated .
But that doesn &apos;t mean CJ can begin searching for another projector .
Impex Rompupel has the possibility to attack the CNSC ruling at the Court of Appeal only after a final ruling of it could be considered finding another projector .
So building consolidation work could resume at least early next year .
Our intention is to restart work as soon as possible .
Basically , rebuilding the technical project should not last long , but we must reach a contract .
&quot; We &apos;re waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not , &quot; said Eckthal .
Work to strengthen the former headquarters of Chestura Pollard began in 2011 .
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012 after allegedly performing $ 4.5 million work .
The tender resumed , with the contract headed by Moldou SA .
However , the firm entered insolvency , with this contract terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei had been sought .
Work has so far been achieved by around 50 % .
Initially , construction , reauthorization and carcasardom of the building had been assessed at 7.7 million lei .
&quot; Ready , I say all ! &quot; - the statement that could criminalise the former Sefga keeper
One of the employees involved in the infamous file at the Cadastral Office signed an agreement to recognise facts , against jail with delay .
His statements most likely will criminalise the others accused , in charge of former Sefa , Narciza Raymond .
An adviser within the Ontario Office of Cadastration and Advertising Immunity ( OCPI ) ISIS accused of DNA in a corruption file has admitted its FAP Treasurer .
An agreement on recognising the facts signed by Dumitru Dawcalu was recorded at Iowa Magistrates Court yesterday , with judges establishing a solution here on September 29th .
Dumitru Daniel Doubcalu has been charged with false intellectual in his continued form and agreed to execute two years of knack with procrastination as well as community work .
As far as Dcalu &apos;s dwindling facts are concerned , prosecutors have made clear that he , as a Cadastrian Office councillor along with fellow colleagues , &quot; falsely drew up several verbal trials of accepting , prising the contracts to carry out services in the genre previously chested by O.C.P.I. IHS Group administrators , SC Topo Euro DRL , SC , CA Treasurer and TAF Lipsa Stefan , who certifies have been fully realised , when they were not carried out and were not lodged in O.C.P.I. Iowa . &quot;
Last days , former Sefa Office spokeswoman Narciza Olivia but also other former or current OCPI employees have been sent to trial on this file , with allegations disconnecting some services to listed firms , though work has not been achieved .

Adventures in stone era
In FRH Chairman Alexandru Dedu &apos;s view , Romania can host major ballistic handball competition only in 2024 , while preparing the women &apos;s handball team for qualification at the Olympic Games cost a fortune .
Romanian Handball Federation President Alexander Dedu said yesterday during a meeting with the media that it is a great pride in our country that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups .
As for Romania &apos;s national women &apos;s handball team , &quot; the main goal is qualification for the Rio Olympic Games , but for that they have to go through two stages of bowl bowlers , first place World Championship and second prequalifying tournament , &quot; Dedu said .
We want us very clear to qualify for the Olympics .
There are fantastic requirements from the technical bullet run by Tomas Ryde .
Staf who will be composed of seven or eight people .
He wants second @-@ hand coach , doctor , two masonry , goalkeeper coaching , physical preparation , head of delegation .
They asked us for getting our qualifications some things , more material for physical preparation , from which I never heard .
That &apos;s all to get to the Olympian Games ; and I &apos;ll do whatever you hold to me to have them .
We talk of a massive investment , there are many , lots of money .
But that &apos;s the way to do performance .
Because we &apos;re in stone era right now with preparation .
&quot; Teams with which we don &apos;t betray these materials and have them for some time , &quot; said Dedu , who noted he was trying to get the sums needed to purchase these products from MTS and VR .
The President of FRH also referred to infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition .
We do not have the hall in Bucharest .
It is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to question a European gymnastics championship .
Let us not forget that Olympic neighbourhoods entirely built in other corners of the world within two years .
Before 1992 , in the current Olympic area Barcelona in Barcelona was a trash dump and now it came a landmark of Beauty .
So did London , where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was a success in terms of investment as well .
&quot; In my vision , in 2024 we can host a major competition in 2024 , &quot; Dedu said .
He added that international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major competition .
It is a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania .
Mr Gatu ran civilised with a project , people gave their consent into principle but quickly made it clear that he would never build the hall .
I , too , had discussions with IOF , we told them we want , that we want , that we are able to organise and they said they agreed and invite them to first match in the new Bucharest hall and afterwards we talk concrete .
&quot; So we have all openness , and at IOF and NHF , but we don &apos;t have the infrastructure , &quot; the FRH official explained .
The former big handball player avoided assessing the chances of female teams CMS Bucharest and Greater Manchester United &apos;s Hockey Baia Mare to get to Final Four : &quot; I have asked all coaches to be booked in pronouns , that if they &apos;re not back against them . &quot;
Good road to World Cup
Romanian Prayer kicks off September 23rd , against France
National rugby team captain Mihai Macovei told a press conference Tuesday that all Romania &apos;s players are ready for England &apos;s World Cup matches where they hope to get two wins : &quot; We &apos;re ready . &quot;
Both my colleagues and colleagues are with engines to maximum turtle .
We trained to give the best yield on the four games .
Everyone will have great expectations , because our goal is to win in two games against Canada and Italy in two games .
All groups are heavy and ours is the same .
Take it slightly , the first time with France and then we will see .
Surely if we win with Canada , if we win with Canada , the match with Italy will be our final .
I cannot describe in words the joy of participation in the World Cup , it is the culmination of so many years of work .
I wish I didn &apos;t disappoint anyone in the family of Rugby and come up with nice results at home .
&quot; We want to be proud of that some players , a small family like Rugby &apos;s e Rugby in Romania , proudly represent the tricolour , &quot; Macovei said .
Romania &apos;s national team manager Lynn Champion , who was at first experience as a World Cup coach , hopes to make Romanians proud of selected rugby : &quot; It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup . &quot;
I &apos;m sure players are ready to take part in the tournament .
It is an extraordinary experience for me .
It is very important for me that every game makes Romanians proud of the national team .
Romanian Rugby Federation president Haralambie Mathas has confidence that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years .

Patania a tourist
A family of Cluj tourists came to Iowa to visit him , but the trip ended with bitter promise .
After my experience , neither my wife nor my wife want to cook in your town anymore .
Without wanting , they have struck out with erroneous information from leaflets , unseeming controller of RAPT controllers and , bonus , fine &quot; as so @-@ called law . &quot;
Salisbury arrived in Iowa days ago , cashing in at a Centre hotel hotel and called for tourist leaflets .
They also got a trick in which RATP paths were crossed .
&quot; Armed &quot; with these maps , husbands visited the Ivenue .
But , two days ago , sitting in Copou , they wanted to get to Palas Mall .
Because it wasn &apos;t tongues with tickets to the station near Copou Park , they relied on printed information on the catcher : That they can take a ticket through SMS .
&apos;i didn &apos;t tell anyone that service no longer exists .
Confident in pliance , they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS following instructions from pliance .
Unfortunately for them , he has made his appearance a controllers team RATP .
They said there was no longer the 2 @-@ year service and that he had announced in the media that he had cancelled .
Me DE where SA know what &apos;s written in local media , I coming up with an evening before visiting the city ?
I spoke to controllers , explained their situation , they said they didn &apos;t care , it &apos;s not their job .
The attitude was very defiant .
They said everything they can do is deie a single fine instead of 2 ( ml and wife ) .
&quot; I paid , I didn &apos;t want to spoil my day visiting the gendarmerie and blaming there ! &quot; Ovidiu explains .
In conclusion , the family was fined due to erroneous information from leaflets and controllers who &quot; applied the law to blood . &quot;
It &apos;s not fair , and we have made a reference to RATP Iowa to recover my money .
It &apos;s not money , I &apos;m not being blown up by many , but the idea is that I felt wrong .
Guessed for rapists in Vaslui .
They had accident and remained in cardiac arrest
The trial of seven rapists from the Cowboys moved to Iowa Magistrates Court yesterday .
Parramatta witnesses judged the first trial term in a non @-@ public session where the seven young men accused of mocking an 18 @-@ year @-@ old girl asked for freedom .
Prior to the actual start of the courtroom , one of the outstanding judges who had been assigned the file , Viorel Munteanu , formulated a request for abstention , what admitted by his court colleagues .
The magistrate activated this year to the Vaslui Tribunal until summer this year , where he was president of station On Treasurer , with him who , on 9 April , admitted a dispute filed by four of the defendants , with their placement under house arrest .
Currently , the file is judged by a complete indictment involving magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Newcastle .
Earlier , on file he formulated an abstention and judge Dan Year Champion , on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship of segregation with one of rapists lawyers .
The two judges decided that rapists from Vaslui remain in preventive custody .
Ti Champion will remain jailed for at least another 30 days when Jude Treasurer will rediscuss the possibility of putting them at large .
A trial deadline will run at Iowa Magistrates Court on October 6 .
Before reaching Iowa Court of Iowa Court of ISIS Appeal , the duba with whom rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the Packers neighborhood , car entering ISIS on his belt .
Autoslitara Iveco with whom the seven rapists were transported struck a Volks Commodore car floating from the street playing and the driver tried to cook on the left .
Duba roam out of an end Packers .
The car went viral in Iowa here because Penitars Administration employees preferred the route from Vaslui to Iowa on tough graphene , then on their belt @-@ catching socks .
They then cut the road down several kilometres .
Immediately after the impact , escort detainees called for another shipment , to take over inmates .
Shortly after the accident came a car from Pennington maximum safety ISIS safety , who took the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal .
Following the accident , none of the detainees were injured .
To transfer them to the other duba , guards surrounded the rear side of the Masi Sharks and the detains went out in speed , two by two .
&quot; The incident has not been reported to Pollard because drivers of the do UA motor vehicles have understood amiable in terms of damage to be paid for , &quot; chief Commissioner Madalin Taranu said from IPJ .
Big migrations
Romania is neither nor will it be prepared for what will follow .
What about Europe ?
I say from the beginning , clear and clear : The 7 000 refugees they should and must naturalise Romania represent , in itself , an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project .
For Romania , even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest , amounting to around 1 500 discards , far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months .
Surely , if those migrants really accept to settle in our cities , the chances of rapid integration into Romanian society are extraordinarily small .
I am sure they will be the first to lose their patience .
Parried by mobsters and paralysed by a vengeance class , the Romanian state proves bogged down in all areas .
Unable to integrate Gypsies is just a banal example .
In addition to that , governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds , make roads , kindergartens or modern schools , ensure decent medical care , raise the mess along the street , create jobs paid honourable or retain their own young generation home .
Why would refugees settle into another country in which they are running away ?
But what makes a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with whom such a crisis is being treated .
We first face fateful bellicia of strong EU states , which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries .
Then comes the friction hypocrisy of Romanians who , although millions of relatives scattered across the world , do not yet accept each other - another religion , other religion , another blood .
Fear not stealing her careva .
After all , there is also hypocrisy of many migrants , who , although they cite only the horrors of war as reason for their departure , do not accept any other destination of exodus than Germany or Nordic countries .
However , not all refugees are Syrians and there is no war in Pakistan .
Likewise , the simplistic way in which the crisis is considered cannot be mocked .
The causes must be eliminated , I support some and , strictly speaking on the card of political correctness , seek peace and investment for migrants &apos; origin countries .
But in Romania there is peace and even falls , from time to time , from time to time , something foreign capital into the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year .
Why do they leave ?
In this crisis , the European Union has been revealed to us as an anatomy , divisive and outdated construct of the situation .
Decrying was crying out that Romania is unable to invent itself a draft country , but IATA that neither the EU possesses any future plan .
And improvisation and threats help nothing .
What more is the EU using , then , if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be questioned because of the waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese ?
At some point , the war in Syria will end .
Not the migrant crisis , however .
Over the coming decades , overpopulation , poverty , climate change , depletion of resources etc. will push millions of desperate migrants out of Asia and especially from Africa to a better life .
Romania , too , is neither nor will Romania be prepared for what will follow .

Two frenzy in Tomai swallowed salmon .
They were taken to hospital
Two 9 @-@ year @-@ olds , respectively 11 , from Tommy , siblings , swallowed several Diazepam pills .
They found the tilt inside the house and took them out of curiosity .
Their mother was following a treatment and medicine wasn &apos;t hidden .
The children were taken emergency at the &quot; holy Mary &quot; hospital in Iowa .
They &apos;re in stable condition , as doctors say .
Exclusive : A meeting that Iti breaks heart .
At 20 he got a brave gift : Biological parents
Lost in hospital in unclear conditions , in the non @-@ hatred of the 90s , when he had only two months of life , little , bolted and helpless , and then passed by a wealthy Italy family , in the same period where adoption was vaguely regulated , a young retired young woman , now a blonde and beautiful girl , reunited the day before in Iowa girl with biological parents in a county village , nearly two decades ago where no one knew anything of the others .
Crine will be going to be 20 years old and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to give her beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift : A visit to Romania in Iowa to know her unclear past .
&quot; The Iowa newspaper , &quot; which assisted the family of Origin efforts after several highly vague hints , witnessed those meetings practically Iti rout the heart .
The coverage of reporters , emotions of moms , statements of those involved , their reactions are downright slow and awesome .
The story of Crucible begins 20 years ago in Corey Prayer , on when he had only two months old .
Then , due to a health problem , the girl had to be internalized in hospital , to the city .
At home they started having misunderstandings between parents and the mother had to parish the residence .
He decided to keep up , and guys to send me from home .
He stopped the girl , and since then I didn &apos;t know anything anymore .
&quot; When I learned that he was in hospital , it was too late , &quot; remembers Jonny Alina , the girl &apos;s biological mother .
Crina was internalized along with her grandmother at Pascani City Hospital and also then the girl &apos;s father , Costic Balcan , left work in Alexandria &apos;s Teleorman County .
Their whim had to break up definitively .
N &apos;t Have Crine at Hospital
After internment , Crine &apos;s father had gone to work in another locality , and returned after six months .
Meanwhile , the girl was transferred to Iowa hospital , and dad , when she returned , didn &apos;t find it anymore .
I think he had spent nearly nine months since the girl was in hospital .
&quot; I &apos;d thought it was abandoned , &quot; he recounts a family granddaughter .
Due to financial problems , the grandmother couldn &apos;t come up with Crine in Iowa , and the girl stayed in the care of doctors .
Because no one more interested in the child &apos;s fate all this time , she was taken by the Directorate General for Social Assistance and Child Protection ISIS , which then gave her to care for the Plastic Plastic Surgery Centre .
There were years when abandonment and adoption were less regulated than today in Romania .
At the Bucium Center was found by the Lib Demore and his wife , a couple from Palermo what they wanted to have their child but did not succeed .
They fell in love with blonde Crine , and after something time she had to move definitively with them to Italy .
The little had already served nearly two years , how long adoption formalities took place .
When I saw Crina , I felt like e was face .
&quot; As if my wife had given her life , &quot; says smiling Commodore , the adoptive father , while catching up in his palm of the thick hand of the face .
In the country , Crine &apos;s parents , Alina and Costica , continued separately searches , each on where he could .
Dad asked authorities in Prairie but received no response where his child might be .
Police then told them she was likely to be handcuffed , but in Iowa parents learned what really happened to them .
When I looked at it here , they told me at the Court that they were leaving Italy , in Palermo .
And conditions to look for her didn &apos;t have .
We asked God to be fine .
I thought about her in all the years that passed away , but there were no possibilities like to humiliate , find it .
&quot; It &apos;s hard , &quot; tells us tears in the eyes of Crouch &apos;s biological mother .
But even if the years passed , Prairie &apos;s parents weren &apos;t forgotten .
In Italy , Commodore and wife explained to her daughter where it comes and that her past connects Romania .
I was small when I learned .
I think we had five or six years old .
I reacted as a copped , I was curious .
&quot; I wanted to know my parents from Romania , &quot; confess to Crina .
And her dream was going to become reality .
In March this year , Chief Commissioner Romica Ierner , director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention , Review and Antidrug Adventures ISIS , was contacted by an acquaintance of Italy , who explained to Italy &apos;s desire for Commodore to find Crash &apos;s biological family .
And the search just started from a name .
After the request we had from our partners in Italy , we started the first steps .
Primisem only a name , Balcan Costic , then locality , Prairie .
Shortly I had a work with City Hall there , and I was able to ask whether there was by locality the name received .
Then they gave me a few indications , only that the person found was not even desirable .
&quot; It took until nearly a month ago until we find the biological father of the face , &quot; explains Chief Commissioner Romica Ierner .
In all , more than three months have taken authorities to track down Cosby and Alina , especially as each resident in another locality .
We started moving somewhere in March , and in June and July we completed identification of biological teams and discussions .
&quot; Then we set out that there was a first meeting in September , &quot; added Romica Ierner .
In the weekend that passed , Alina and Costic saw their first face lost to the hallway of Iowa hospital 20 years ago .
Dad , excited , barely can contain his tears , and the hands of her treadmill relentlessly .
It barely changes some words with those around .
A week before the meeting , neither could they sleep .
He was all excited , hate .
&quot; Like to see your child after so many years , it &apos;s something , &quot; says one granddaughter , cast and she with Costic from Prairie .
Meet Crunch With Her Mother and brother
In talk to her face , who is expected to study at an well @-@ rated university in Italy , Costic Balcan told him , among other things , that if he once wants to return to him , in the village , come quiet : II can give something sheep , goats , like to find a boy from the village and clinch a household .
Mother e and she moved , crying , and believe hard that something like that can happen to them .
I &apos;m very embarrassed .
I didn &apos;t think anything like that could happen .
I &apos;ve seen so cases on TV , I &apos;ve ever thought about these years , I hoped , but I didn &apos;t think I could be , too .
They &apos;re very big emotions .
If they could forgive me .
I hope we will visit us in the future .
&quot; I hope we can keep a connection , &quot; tells us with great tears at Jacobi Alina , Crine &apos;s mother while keeping tight in her hand a serviceable .
He still hides his tears , thankfully , because soon he will see herself facing them after so much bitter weather .
By contrast , Crina , who will turn across just days later this month , 20 , is trying to calm himself like an emotional kid .
He doesn &apos;t know what to expect but sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents .
He thinks they &apos;re young , but now before the meeting tries to collect their thoughts , because he has a lot to say but nothing to reproach the village .
My parents are two mothers and two fathers .
But my parents are up to the end of those who grew up me up .
It &apos;s going to be a nice encounter , wonderful experience .
&quot; I hope I have a nice memory with them because now there &apos;s so much to say , &quot; he told us Crina .
First Family Meeting in Iowa
In Uncle Square , under the skies of early autumn skies , the family in Prairite again reunite their destiny with their face in Palermo .
Crina now has 20 , finishing high school , after the Italian school model , but can begin a new chapter with Alina and Cosby , her biological parents .
There are no borders or countries apart from them , but only a barrier : Language .
Fish which , with the help of an interpreter , a local owner at the centre of Isis , have easily passed away .
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first event of this kind , and that , in future , if there is an opportunity , they will do it .
It &apos;s the first such event of this kind held , like an emotional caravan , and I am happy to be successful .
We at the Centre have different activities , and often we associate ourselves as an institution which only deals with consumer addicts .
But we &apos;re trying to bring society back to society something good back .
&quot; If I &apos;d be asked for such a venue , I &apos;ll do it with great pride , &quot; says smiling Romica Ierner , director of the Regional Center for Disease Prevention , Review and ISIS Antidrug Adventures .
Behind him , Balcan &apos;s family , with Crina in the middle , walk away from telling them .
They &apos;re understandable : They have much to tell each other .
Armistiu with arms on his leg yesterday at PSD .
Everyone pulls its soul
Camps in the PSD grand branch branch sealed a gun truce on foot .
After successive rounds of talks Friday through Sunday , the first being and the most tense , PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities .
Sprinkled by party Executive Chairman Liviu Dragnea to present a united position , extraordinary Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party posts .
Far from over , domestic war within the party appears to have taken only pause to allow combatants to draw their soul .
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum .
It has launched a very simple and very present message in now : Try to find a solution not to jeopardise the party .
We have elections in the party on 3 October .
All functions will be made available to those who want them .
&quot; Until then , we remain in the existing structure , &quot; Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica said .
The two days of weekend talks only resulted in the conclusion that nothing was defined .
Fierce competition is expected in October elections for president of the PSD branch of the PSD .
On the short list of potential candidates for the main post in the party &apos;s frontbencher is state secretary Maricel Popa , Senator Florin Constantinescu , Senator Sorin Lazar , County councillor Vasile Catea and acting president of the County Council , Victorel Lupu .
The mayor of como Schitu Lead Mihai Mihalache could add to them .
One option considered is also the candidacy of PSD mayoral advisers Cristian Stanaou if Lupu no longer enroll in the race , with party sources saying he was not interested in office .
The only name not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader George Nichita .
The list of candidates is open .
According to status , including on elections day applications can be submitted , applications can be submitted , and would not Mira Mira if it happened .
&quot; Importantly , we remain united , and we will remain until 3 October , when we have a new Executive Office , a new county Permanent Office and all new leadership structures , &quot; said Catea .
Until the organisation of the internal elections is held , leadership of the PSD county branch will be secured by Victory &apos;s Victorian Lupu , a close to Nichita and Stananov .
Lupu , however , are on leave until September 29th , preparing elections practically expected to be secured by the branch &apos;s chief executive , County councillor Mikhail Popescu , in cold relations with Nichita camp .
Contacted phone , Cristian Stananov praised the talks in recent days that leading to &quot; partial consensus . &quot;
There &apos;s broad availability to maintain balance and unity in the party .
Partly consensus has been reached for supporting a unitary team to deal with county cricket .
&quot; But on the other hand there are several variants concerning intentions regarding candidacy for the PSD Iasi presidency , with the list remaining open , &quot; Stanchev commented .
Nottingham judge refused Rangers file on grounds of solitary confinement
The seven young Rangers County men convicted of rape arrive today at Iowa Magistrates Court .
Vasluiinians sentenced to penalties between five years and eight months and eight months and four years and four months will present their arguments on putting them at large today , after the substantive court , Judge Jon Stewart , established their imprisonment immediately after sentencing .
The file was recorded at the Court of Appeal late last week , with magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstention , admitted by his colleagues .
Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants &apos; lawyers , lawyer Bogdan Luca , is competing with her daughter , lawyer Dana Anton .
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada , the one who received his greatest punishment on this file .
How motivated judges ruling
Late last week , the magistrate from Judges , who sentenced seven youths , motivated the ruling .
In motivating judge talks about the defiant reaction of defendants but also those who supported them , saying such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among public opinion .
&quot; The court finds that after the time being conducted under the preventive measure of judicial control , restrictive measure of freedom but not grounds of freedom , under the impact of the attitude of defendants , families and local supporters , it has been felt at local and national community levels a strong sense of indignation that persons accused of serious facts are judged under a less restrictive measure , &quot; the motivational speaker of the Vaslui Chamber said .
Magistrates also dismantled and the main defence of seven defendants during the trial invoked that the girl they raped was not &quot; church door . &quot;
&quot; The sublime court that it lacks relevance to the moral quality of the injured person , something the defendants wanted to emphasise through appearances they formulated , since one person &apos;s physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext , &quot; the motivation said .
Corbyn , Brexit &amp; Future of Europe
For economic and demographic causes , prosperity enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue in the coming years .
Until Saturday probably little world knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is .
Even today , having become the new leader of Britain &apos;s Labour Party , many wonder to what extent it can affect our election of a politician who , after all , is not in a position of decision .
Jeremy Corbyn is Labour &apos;s most radical leftist leader after war .
Marxist declared , anti @-@ monarchy ( asked at some point Tony Blair , then the prime minister , to pull the royal family out of Buckingam Palace ) , a rude anti @-@ American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin ( who was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel &quot; Russia Today &quot; ) , and Hezbollah terrorist movements and Hamas , he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and emerge from NATO and the EU .
For Corbyn , who considered killing Osama bin Laden at the time , a real tragedy , ISIS is almost preferable to the United States .
After the model of all populist demagogues , Corbyn has , of course , miraculous anti @-@ austerity solutions .
Things like the kind of guys he was saying and promised and Tsipras to Greece until when he shook his chest with the real world and economic legalization .
The economic programme of the new Labour leader provides , among other things , renationalisation massive renationalisation and printing money as a solution to financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits .
Sure , some may wonder why the solution with printing money is not unanimous on the globe , then we would have a global overall prosperity then , but who would prevent such details from occurring again .
Sure , we can charge the blood on bankers , you become a kind of enemy service enemy of the Left , but as far as has seen so many times in the past , not only in former communist states or Ecuador or Venezuela or Venezuela , but also in France at the beginning of Mitterrand and Hollande &apos;s mandates .
Extra sums are quickly swallowed up by generous , contactless promises made by populist demagogues .
As Margaret Thatcher pointed out , &apos; the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others ends &apos; .
Few give real chances to Jeremy Corbyn to ever get the prime minister .
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader Michael Foot , who anyway wasn &apos;t as extreme as belief as the party &apos;s premiership leader , failed miserably in the election .
And then there &apos;s still a working class in Britain in the classic sense of word , relatively consistent and structured .
And unions were most influential than now .
Under the new industrial landscape where services are dominant throughout the workforce , and expanded automakers have made industry massive needed in industry massively needed , Corbyn &apos;s rhetoric has limited appeal .
But , even out of opposition , he can influence important developments that can directly affect us .
In its last Financial Times he believes Corbyn &apos;s election increases the chances of Brexit , namely Britain &apos;s exit from the EU .
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of country membership in the Union .
In the eyes of the radical Left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor .
When combative this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right , with anti @-@ immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis rocking out EU foundations , you end up getting explosive blend .
And not just for Britain .
But if Britons decide in the wake of the referendum , which would be held by 2017 , leaving the Union loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and deep flak created inside it by the euro crisis and now that is why refugees , between North and South , between East and West , leave room for scenarios of most worrying .
All the more so as for a whole range of Member States , London was a counterpoint to the Franco @-@ German axis ( in which Berlin anyway becomes increasingly the dominant actor ) .
True , British business , City City , are powerful lawyers for remaining the country into the EU .
Europe today is no longer the one in the past .
There &apos;s a lot of resentment , growing in intensity just these weeks .
The problem is that Brussels , we even had a specimen recently in Jean Cluj &apos;s speech by Junker , increasingly tends to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of Member States consulting with only a few European powers , mainly Germany .
And that &apos;s when electoral support for anti @-@ system formations , anti @-@ immigration formations that are at the same time , too Eurosceptic , is increasing dramatically across the continent .
In other words , the emotional climate with negative cargo has reached higher rates than ever before .
Hence the conclusion the Financial Times draw when assessing Brexit &apos;s chances .
The pro @-@ EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves from national interest .
If voters take their decision , then Britain will remain in the EU .
But Corbyn &apos;s victory reminds us of the power of excitement in current politics .
However , Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments .
Especially if , as expected , we will see greater integration of the euro area , pushing most states in the region and the periphery of interest and part of Europe &apos;s decision process .
Corbyn , Tsipras and Syriza in Greece , Podemos in Spain , even Bernie Sanders in the United States are feeding their populist rhetoric from frustrations accrued in oocious societies .
For economic and demographic causes , the prosperity enjoyed over the last decades , generous social benefits cannot continue in the coming years .
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis , the euro zone - immigration , both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken account of the integrationist political ambitions , not the capacity and readiness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges , turbulence on the continent , internal tensions within the continent will increase in intensity and potentially affect Romania &apos;s situation major .
It is hard to exclude anything from the point of view of possible scenarios .
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to face such complicated situations .
Constantin Brancusi , the tarmac .
Rockefeller : &quot; How can I help you ? &quot;
Brancusi : &quot; Takes and mature the workshop ! &quot;
The great sculptor had a great dream : To be someone , to get famous , to hear about him worldwide .
But behind the recount , or hiding anything almost forgotten today , when millions of success stories are delivered , recipes for success in life , are delivered to us .
That something also has a name .
Call &quot; truddle . &quot;
What to write about Constantin Brancusi ?
What is more to say , actually ?
His figure appeared on banknotes .
And soon a known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in a publicity stunt .
Brancusi produces and delivering money nearly 60 years since he is no longer among us .
There are hundreds of streets and boulders in Romania wearing their name .
Incidentally , even the author of this text lives on one of these streets .
And when he emerges apart from oops to , he hears the following instructions : &quot; We go to the park , Brancusi . &quot;
The country is crowded with its statuettes .
There are few Romanian personalities whose works will be known by so much world , from children , to the elderly .
Brancusi &apos;s ability to infiltrate Brancusi is a huge one .
Neither Communists managed to excel Romania from Romania &apos;s memory and culture .
Its quotations crowded the internet today , receiving hundreds of thousands of SMEs and SMEs .
And then again , again , what would he be to say , actually writing about this guy ?
Viewed from the bunch of books and articles trying to recreate their destiny , Brancusi &apos;s life looks almost fantastic , totally unlikely .
You know , they &apos;re those people telling you that if you didn &apos;t have luck to bury them in any big city and in a family how much you &apos;re getting richer , your chances of success alive are almost nil .
Brancusi &apos;s life is the perfect counterexample .
And maybe here would be a key .
Perhaps here should be the beginning of the text here to begin .
With a ruling , however frivolous they are .
Uses success stories creepy , which will be delivered daily in newspapers and TV shows .
Watch carefully this man &apos;s figure .
Vintable to know how to succeed in life like , how , today , by him he heard a whole globe ?
It is simple .
He worked all life to be someone .
That &apos;s what he did .
Constantin Brancusi is born on 19 February 1876 , in Hobita , a small village in Common Pestisani , Gorj County , at the foot of the Carpathian basin .
It is Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi &apos;s fifth child .
Although he came from a family of affluent peasants Brancusi takes a modest life , but one that he had to reap his repertoire will guide his late feminism vision .
Recalling childhood and places where she grew up , the artist had to confess , in a meeting with Petre Tutea , from 1933 , from 1933 : &quot; On then life was nice and harmonious . &quot;
For millennia , people bumped , happy , a patriarchal life .
Everything was going quiet from one season to another .
And do you know why things have changed ?
The civilization of the great city has come to us .
Brancusi &apos;s Copilaria was but far from an idyllic one .
One of the moments spent in these years of life is highly indicative of the combination of purity and violence that characterised his future sculptor years in his native town .
The moment is reproduced in the work of &quot; Brancusi . &quot; A biography , &quot; written by Alexander Bujar .
In 1879 , Constantin Brancusi had 3 years old .
In the autumn of that year , when the tuica was made &quot; every year , &quot; tracing those who sample the liquidation as seeing if the process unfolds as required , Brancusi catches a moment of general unconscious .
Fill his cavities with tubes and drink on the nerves .
Falls in sleep almost instantly .
The first people only notice after a few minutes .
Mother enters panic , then in hysteria , believing that son died .
Towards the evening , when father Radu , returns from vines accompanied by lauts , he sees the desperate signs of those who eagerly await her breath .
The party immediately turns into jale .
Dad already thinks of Fenway .
Yet someone finds that e well has a phone on Baba Brandusa , the sheep &apos;s gift and serviceable serve .
Brandusa checks the baby &apos;s breath , then puts her under the nose of horse @-@ panned horse gathered from the edge .
Baby thug strong .
The world applauds .
As the boy e left sleeps further , joy party party continues with even more force .
The second day , father and son meet through orchards .
Radu Brancusi puts Constantin to collect some nude and bring them up .
Dad ashires his baby with her head down and , with his little boy nukes , beats him as to keep mind .
And while it feels garlic blows , breakfast Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective too , and that things around can appear overturned .
Especially the sun &apos;s standing , different from the well @-@ known one , makes him wonder , as they have to admit in old age , if not somehow astray participates in his disturbance .
Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father of what happened to him ? &quot;
Currently City don &apos;t work
An MP calls for politicians to remember those who voted for them .
Independent deputy Viorel Blhelp called on PSD and PNL to cease domestic infighting and refocus their agenda towards the electorate .
What we see now on our political scene is a great division and both .
I &apos;ve seen nothing of the USL projects in 2012 to continue .
Neither motorway nor Regional Emergency Hospital only see how politicians dispute their possible sites according to real estate interests .
Let us leave a little bit aside politics , gather and talk .
At present , the city isn &apos;t working .
&quot; If Esti occupied with domestic war , you don &apos;t have any time for those who chose you , &quot; Blhelp said .
He appreciated that the current political class disappointed the graduate electorate , with a consequence expected to be a very low turnout in upcoming local elections , around 30 % figure , representing practically the faithful electorate of parties .
The deputy also believes voters will move towards mainstream parties as well , expressing reservations about new political initiatives such as the &quot; For Iowa &quot; party that will be launched today .
Local parties have very little chances and will only break up from the electorate of the right , not PSD .
Such parties rely on civic active people , who rule are right .
&quot; It &apos;s crumbling further right , which is not good for anyone , nor for the PSD , &quot; Blhelp said .
He made clear he was not interested in a bid at upcoming local elections , denying rumours of his intention to enroll in mayoral race .
I &apos;ve also said I don &apos;t want to run for any local office .
I am thinking of whether to continue as an MEP and in his future mandate .
I tried to call for unity for Iowa and in discussions on the hallway , with other MPs , and I was accused of wanting to file a picture .
I don &apos;t want but we can &apos;t go on like that anymore .
&quot; If people have voted in us , it doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re fools to vote if they see nothing , &quot; Blhelp said , who appreciated that the main reason voters no longer interested in politics is hypocrisy aloft .
A colleague from Jazasi said he didn &apos;t get his money and have to go bus .
Let us not be hypocritical .
There is no money .
Sometimes I feel ashamed to raise money from casiery .
At the end of my term of office I will report everything we have spent , outside the salaries of employees from cabinet employees and its maintenance .
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei in one month , with all transport disconnect , accommodations and others .
&quot; Telling an MP they &apos;re not getting his money e clean hypocrisy , &quot; Blhelp concluded .
