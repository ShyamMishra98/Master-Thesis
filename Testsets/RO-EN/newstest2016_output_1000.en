UN chief says no military solutions to Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki moon says Russia's response to Russia's military support for Syria is that there is no military solution to the conflict lasting nearly five years and more weapons would only exacerbate violence and suffering millions of people .
The UN chief urged all parties again , including the divided UN Security Council to unify and support negotiations in order to find a political solution .
Ban said at a conference Wednesday that he planned to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries permanently present on the council this month - the US , Russia , China , England and France - on the edge of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria .
Ban voiced regret that divisions within the council and between Syrian people and regional powers have made this intractable situation .
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons , tackling such a crisis in Syria .
8 figures in polls showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have been trying to label him as a fridge flop .
Others called him a joke .
And others await implosion .
But no matter how some Republicans try to remove Donald Trump from the top of polls , it hasn't worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leads with a share of two figures and some are starting to ask himself seriously what this means for the chances of nominating real estate mogul .
Of course , it's still premature .
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republicans nomination .
Pundling shows that in the same period of 2011 , Rick Perry's lead was playing Herman Cain in the polls , but none of them won in any state in the nomination race .
And the reasons why it would struggle hard at the general election are numerous .
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth concede Trump's power and start backing him with money .
Next we present some figures in recent polls suggesting the real estate mogul isn't just anything passing :
Figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees .
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy , in mid June , a survey by Monmouth University shows just two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
By mid July , the percentage climbed to 40 per cent .
At the beginning of August , it was 52 per cent .
Currently six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump .
About three out of 10 say they have a negative view .
These numbers remain .
A survey conducted by Quinnipiac last week in Iowa concluded 60 % of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump .
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won't win the nomination race .
In a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be excited or happy if Trump won't win the race for the nomination .
Only two out of 10 say they would be upset if Trump wins the nomination race .
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm that Trump ( 43 per cent say would be excited about 40 per cent who say the same about Trump ) .
Closest to enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio , by just 21 per cent .
On the side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be unhappy or upset if Jeb Bush favourite wins the nomination race .
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament a problem .
Although Donald Trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and his bombastic style , 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide consider the real estate mogul with temperament temperament to be president , according to ABC News / The Washington Post's poll Monday .
Regent the same figures in the state of Iowa , where Trump 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be ruler , according to Quinnipiac poll last week .
Yet 44 per cent believe he lacks the personality needed to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents say temperament doesn't have what he looks like at the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are rife with the idea .
When I take the attitude of intellectuals , Republican voters find Trump authentic .
According to a CNN / ORC poll last week , on question who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race , four out of 10 said Trump .
The situation changed towards the end of July when four out of 10 would have gambled on Jeb Bush .
Full information : In the past , GOP voters didn't read very well the future .
During the same period of last elections , four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the nomination race , compared to just 28 percent for Mitt Romney .
But these figures show most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible .
Even if Republicans or replay for another candidate ; Trump still tops everyone .
Some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to Trump's win while prop Donald Trump will split up to more than a dozen candidates .
But a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in hypothetical situation of collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates , almost always Trump will benefit from majority support .
Trump is in the distance of 13 points by Carly Fiorina , 14 points from Marco Rubio , at 15 Walker points , at 19 points from Jeb Bush and eventually every 33 points against Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie .
It's almost on par with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would beat businessman by 19 points in hypothetical one one showdown at one .
Most supporters of Donald Trump say they have decided .
In the vestige he was put his oxygen mask .
Playing .
I am not a doctor , but a double replay fractures is six months old and will not play in the group stages .
I hope they can play this season again .
Moreno appears to have had luck and escaped red card and concession a penalty kick .

England's team mates have an extra reason to recover to play at France's European Championship next year in June .
Phillip Cocu , coach PSV , said : It's a very ugly injury .
Everyone is very sad when one player suffers such injury .
Our Player of the Year never watch to injure an opponent .
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's national flag against Holland's team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship .
II is very hard because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent , and when you hear he's a very serious injury , it's not good , Cocu said .
I didn't see the stage .
I didn't manage to see than the ball , heading in another direction , so it seemed like &#91; Moreno &#93; reached it but we couldn't see the intervention on Luke .
In his statement for SBS6 , Moreno said : I know how it's , I know how difficult it is to get through something like that .
I feel bad , sorry , sorry .
PSV player Andr√©s Battado has also reached hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling .
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission but still holds out loud
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament , I'm not taking into account a repeat defeat of 3 0 in Test matches .
I would not eliminate any possible trip victory either .
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on thorn in the batting line and collective morale is strong ; they will not be marked by the 2012 developments but will have a youthful positive attitude .
Moeen Ali evolves as spider and Adil Rashid , even if he's unknown at the Test level , represent an option for the attack .
Similar subjects : Adam Lyth left England team for Test matches and was replaced by Alex Helected
Obviously as his main coach at Yorkshire , it's difficult to look at the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team .
Played his seven Test against two good strikers , in difficult conditions and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged after results .
There were no questions about Joe Root , for example , until the announcements were made because - and I said that previously - players are their own selection .
Any fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have extended his Lib Dems but his destiny lies in his hands .
I hope if he does more cricket for Yorkshire will have other opportunities .
England's leading coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when performance wasn't on his ability and doesn't surprise me this ; before all , he's a team man .
It's hard to respond to the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the Test matches .
Lyth had seven tweets - like Sam Robson ahead of him - while Nick Compton had nine .
Only Compton had luck at home and travelling .
The only grievance you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean Tour - when Lyth was in full form - but that missed opportunity is of the past .
Teamwork comes Alex Helected , a batsman I'm scoring very well .
He's a cricket player who has X Factor and whom I've noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Sharks .
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before us , but this will naturally depend on the composition of the UAE team .
It was launched the idea that Moeen would open to beating alongside Cook , which would lead extra spimp while preserving four bucks , and I have nothing against .
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left hander player has already shown he's given naibies .
Perhaps Moeen didn't bring success in his district , Worcestershire , but it was No 3 for them , so the difference isn't great .
My old team teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches 38 as Treasurer before entering open in 2001 .
He deleted three centuries immediately and didn't look behind .
Zafar Anjump comes to the team on the back up job spider , and although I've had limited contact with him , he struck me as a very impressive young man .
People might judge early early age - with an average of 31 to beating and 35 at the ball - and they might think it's a password , but there's no bunch of nests and selecting opted for youth .
He's going to learn a lot from this tournament .
England have brought some changes to the coaching team as well .
Mahela Jayawardene's appointment to Sri Lanka's batsman as a consultant for test matches could be a master blow .
He's one of the best players and he'll bring great experience , given he played in any situation and against all sorts of attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes for White's White Bowl player and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition .
I've always thought he was born to engage in international cricket , whether as a player or as a coach , and like Mahela , he has intuitive .
Sometimes new voices in the vestige , even though they convey messages that have passed away and previously , can bring fresh air into the team .
Colly Durham teammates Ben Stokes rest for one day matches , Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
While I'm not all OK , coaches and selecting do not do the program .
And you have to note , players'jobs depend on the results they get .
Such decisions never take lightly .
Brexit camp may win win if economics keep in disarray by 2017
As he passes , David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU getting louder into the mess , even without picking brilliant Jeremy Yes or not ? Corbyn at Labour leadership or TTIP brings serious criticism from Europe Tuesday .
Strangers also have characters such as Corbyn and Nigel Farridge .
A European diplomat explained last days that -- submerged in crises similar to that in the EU - not all domestic injuries - some member states are powered by Britain's agenda of concessions and changes to the treaties , which most do not want .
In Brighton , during the annual meeting , TUC decided they didn't even want it if they erode social protection .
We might even call Dave and George's agenda selfies .
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , do a poise in front of a famous local monument , with or without local representative , then return home and say they have gained allies for reform .
It's just about me .
My European friend , who wants a Great Britain with the prospect of outside under the EU roof - Don't let ourselves alone with France , Berlin says - suggests that more ministers and shortsighted officials from some capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether they stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , the highly cautious German chancellor , is a but has been at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation clapped up , like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) who sat too much .
In 2017 French President Fran√ßois Hollande will be re elected or replaced .
And his strength is in decline .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right wing government , Spain one wing .
It's hard to believe they will help the English who pose , whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from getting out of Britain - something they don't want either , because most have similar separatist tendencies .
So some ministers might even tend to even intentionally make remarks that do not help , in SNP style , in campaigning for Britain's 2017 referendum to speed up the Brexit process , my ammy suggests .
Renegotiation was fixed and Britain has achieved nothing of value from renegotiation .
Europeans know on their skin how vibrant Street can be and how sceptical they are from the oligarchy media who view the EU with skepticism as they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 referendum in report 2 : 1 .
He can vaguely recall Boris Johnson , the Euro opportunistic , who became famous in the early 90s when he was fond of Brussels .
Ed Miliband knew his enemies .
They included the mixture of finding non deductible , strangers who defraud phone and pseudo domi holding most important newspapers .
In fact Tony Blair is seeing them a little bit like he realised that when Esti locked in a cage alongside a nervous gorilla , you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating at lunch and again at tea .
In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum , considering Blair made a nod to the principle of the abandoned EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , giving him a exit card .
Media didn't forgive him for that either .
But Jeremy Corbyn , who has reached me girlfriends in his back Monday at Westminster - told him not to consume his time with me anymore - appears at risk to pass the Murdoch boycott strategy from 1980s , a mistake then and now .
It can take , but they have to develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media , not mine with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position on the BBC left her holiday Sunday .
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call for evolution .
He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU .
Most of those who disagree with the Conservatives anglicism might agree to that .
That's what Hilary A Benn , but not a Benn Benn on radio and TV this week , when the researcher in him struggled not to admit that John McDonnell's appointment by Corbyn as shadow minister on financial issues was a bad idea .
He reminded me of the 1970s when his father struggled on TV to be unfair to fellow Labour colleagues without going too far and without losing his job in cabinet .
Hilary's battle was more attractive .
But the fight to remain in any situation - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said , nor what JC told colleagues and MPs during private meeting Monday night .
Regardless of the picture Corbyn wants to convey it out - note , it has reminded me and me - discipline discipline remains important in the era of television and especially in the limelight of social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
It's fair not to be given Cameron a ticket for favour in Europe , allowing him to take good backing Labour in the referendum campaign , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that .
But McDonnell's core softness and Corbyin on EU membership - in line with their EU membership - in line with their anti capitalist past - no longer constitute just a heated discussion among leftist dissidents why the narrative of small gap is a central dogma .
As with his driving force on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not make the exit campaign - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital Berlin - and there are suspicious voters there - for concessions towards Britain when everything might be worthless ?
The US is already pretty disappointed about the poor Brazilian military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a conservative government cutting costs , as reminded me at launching British Airways at the Security Forum , on Monday .
Specialists criticise England Public Health Department decision on electronic cigarettes
According to the researchers , what a government agency said that electronic cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people , some of which links to tobacco industry .
Specialists from the British British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) editorial team experts joined Lancet in criticising evidence used by the Public Health Department of England ( PHE ) in its report on electronic cigarettes .
PHE published the landmark report last month and described it as a complex analysis of evidence .
But several researchers questioned the data sound robust and pointed fingers at links between certain experts and tobacco industry .
An article published last month in Lancet medical magazine attacked the extraordinarily fragile basis he founded PHE the main conclusion .
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have questioned what they said and set themselves on solid earth or on mystical sand .
Martin McKee , a European public health professor at London School of Hygiene and tropical Sharks , and Simon Capewell , professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University , said : A fundamental principle of clinical health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness .
They said they expected Ms E's claims that current estimates show electronic cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking are underpinned by detailed analysis of evidence and patterns .
In truth , one meeting attended by 12 people led to drawing up a model analysis model with multiple criteria ( MCDA ) to synthesized their views on negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine ; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper .
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company titled EuroSwiss Health , which executive director said had previously received financing from British American Tobacco for conducting an independent study .
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability , he said .
They added that one of 12 attendees at the meeting said funding received from an electronic cigarette maker , but not funding which there were reports that there would be reports of cigarette producing company Philip Morris International .
Arguments were not provided on the basis of which arguments on which table members were selected , but among them were several petals known in electronic cigarette production , some even say in work finance industry funding .
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
The head of the tobacco control section at PHE was also attended at the meeting .
The group research drafted convincingly whitewashed that there is a lack of solid evidence of the detrimental effect most of the products have according to most criteria , McKee and Capewell said .
However , in the PHE report , none of those links or limitations are mentioned .
McKee and Capewell said Ms PHE claims that so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes constitutes a factor encouraging smoking among children or non smokers are premature .
Professor Kevin Fenton , director of PHE health department health department , says she has responded in the past to what BMJ claims .
He said : Electronic badges are significantly less harmful than smoking
One in two people who smoked all life loses his life because of this vice president .
All evidence suggests the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health are minor compared , but we must continue to study the effects in the long run .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about information arising and those which do not stem from evidence , especially given the high degree of public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
Annually , some 880,000 people lose their lives because of an associated disease associated with smoking , while annual costs incurred by the NHS because of smoking reach ¬£ 2 billion .
Clearly Expreview the current evidence - namely that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks , they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfil our national duty .

Ads shame Britain's arms trade

Horrific deadly drones !

And electrical batons causing horrible pain without letting traces !
The joyful voice and animated footage does not leave doubt that this advert for the largest world arms fair is a fierce blade by Amnesty International to highlight the desire of British authorities to sell weaponry to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Squad through Sony Centre in the London'Docklands .

But a separate campaign also led to the display of large numbers of posters in bus stations and in theaters needing a second look .

One of the parody announcements produced by Special Patrol Group .
According to Gavin Grindon , curator Rachel Deeigh and a lecturer at Essex University , artists are asking more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside of galleries .
Many artists head to collaboration with activists in protest movements , realising they have to get out in the real world so that their art impacts society .
Another poster against gun trade welcoming commuters circulating underground .
The footage produced by Amnesty had more than 100,000 Facebook views within 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency who worked pro bono , and graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was shocked by the silence around advertising for the arms fair - with empty space on the Exeter calendar - and thought Let's give them the campaign they try to avoid .
They played with making a more realistic advert but enriching it with loud animations and colors , it was more striking .
They did a great job helping us increase interest in selling equipment of illegal torture under the Fair , says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty .
Now , it would require UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door .
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the Weapons Fair comes from inside Miami , where exhibitors offer fantastic products of euphemism .
In a press release , Saab leaked an order received from the US military on AT4CS RS with support launcher .
It includes a unique form fox that gives stunning effects behind the armur inside the target .

Eight gold rules to live in Camin
It's been 11 years since I moved to Camin , when I was a 19 year old , who still believed in Berete and moral dexterity , but barely now I remember forced smiles of those I annoy I am - and the numerous complaints to others .
Most of the things we learned can be summarised in the form of eight simple rules .
Moving into Camin can bring stats ranging from nervous descent to horror .
Palaszageal is tempting : Telling people where you live , if and where you've spent a year break from studies , what you think of Corbyn and why honestly , Iti is no uncommon because , on good boys , he's no stranger because , on good boys , he's nothing other than Treasurer HAHAHA , find me in my bedroom .
Repirates deep .
And help others breathe - put questions and show interested .
They Anima conversation and help you differentiate people you like with those with whom you wouldn't even stand up if they came the Broncos and they would be the only ones who would have boats .
Don't suffocate people .
Bedrooms often abound by drinks parties , film evenings and social networking sites , but they are also where people dress up and probate their intimidating lenses .

None of this culture is allowed to say , Te I like and want to stay friends , but I want to plank to recover my energy that I consumed interacting with you .
Try reporting when a colleague is interviewer - and try sending an SMS instead of batting outdoors .
Get beaten to the door : Do it .
One guy who sat at the same Camin with me had a policy saying that if a door was not incubators , then he was invited to enter .
He saw enough of it .
Make friends cook .
Given you start university in Bake off fever , if you're batting at someone's door to make consciousness and go and plate it with negrese , it seems less odd , less gender of the situation in 1950s , welcome to the neighborhood , I cooked something , now smiles and I put personal questions .
Cooking cooked in the house is a great way to make friends .

Obviously , if steroids pudding someone's pudding is theft , but if you take a milk drop like putting chicken into tea is all theft ?
Intrigued the owner .
Iti probably tells you to serve yourself even if you're cooked inside .
If someone steal things , it's annoyed and understand you - you're still trying to deal with the problem more mature than my Camin , who has coloured milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole .
Now he's in jail .
Don't make noise that doesn't let others sleep or study .
That's not just because you're holding good sense but because you're going on your own on the franchise .
A nurse girl with me asked his neighbour to give music more slowly because he was 3 morning old and had an exam morning .
Their reaction was to give music louder .

Seven's Sunshine dominates polls despite attempts by Channel Nine to broadcast to Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent movement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of consequences of changes from Liberal party leadership have not brought significant audience growth for Today .
Channel Nine's matecraft delivered from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull .
The Sunshine competition , moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was caught in London as part of a series of broadcast coverage over the course of several weeks , which included Dubai , New York , Casfall Niagara and Cancun .
This cruelty of the distance seemed to count too much for Aussie TV viewers , Sunshine having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities , compared to Today by 339,000 .
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday's hearing ( 3171,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283,000 ) but figures were lower than last Thursday ( 333,000 ) .
Today has lowered the gap to Sunshine in recent months .
In August , Today had an average audience of 31818,000 and Sunshine Coast 330,000 .
At the beginning of the year , the gap varies between 40,000 and 50,000 .

Why I'm witnessing execution in Oklahoma
Later today , except for a belated legal intervention , I shall look how one man is sentenced to death .
If it happens , and I hope not to happen , I will sit in a room for observers from the Oklahoma State prison execution hall and see how Richard Giffe is executed by administering lethal injections .
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
The invitation came first in January via his best friend , and although I was shocked , I accepted .
As the day is approaching , I am appalled by the idea .
The ASA that why do I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell everybody story about capital punishment .
It would provide a unique perspective .
True , journalists can witness executions in America and , because usually applications exceed the number of seats available , a macabre lottery occurs instead of deciding who will be elected .
Oklahoma have reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five .
Those elected will look at execution with impartiality .
I cannot do that .
I'd sit next to Richard Gacquarie's closest friends , in addition I've developed my own connection with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours a half hours .
Likes type .
Radem often much when we talk .
Prison authorities say they cannot be witness and journalist as well , so it will not allow me to have a carnett and a pix to score what they see .
I'll have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist in Oklahoma has accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality .
IATA the lesson .
She tells the story of the detainee as he wants , getting access .
I cried at her .
He admitted he could have formula better , but still feels wrong .
Richard Giffe disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote them .
I don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even do it if they asked me .
I told him he can remove me from the witness list whenever .
However , it wants an international report to write about the subject .
It believes that if he dies , advertising will help movement against capital punishment .
Kim Belller , reporter at Huffington Post , will be with me .
If you mean doing more about the case , listen to the multimedia file series we have made .
I won't come back here on all details .
I can't certainly say Richard Giffe is innocent .
His actions after Barry Van Treese murder are guilty of complicity .
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty .
I think his execution is wrong .
And I'll look him dying from that perspective .
I can't claim I'm totally objective .
For that , you can read articles written by other reporters .
From me you'll find out how it's to watch a man you like dying unnecessarily .
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy against him and threatening to pull out of racing
Peter Moody said Queensland Racing Victoria chief attempted to infiltrate a spy at his graphies last year and threatened to immediately retire from racing .
It launched an attack against the Rebels and Racing Victoria's integrity department , calling them running a personal campaign against him , the straw that filled out the glass as removing Lady Tatai in the race because of a treatment administered during race day .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for races and that he's put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome to Lidari's test for Broncos another for which he has no explanation .
For 18 months swallowed his words about statements about spies and didn't want to resemble foxpea that doesn't reach grapes .
I wasn't going to say anything connected to that aspect and I went silent long but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything bursts out suddenly , Moody said .
It's known he continued .
Sometimes react and you have to bear the consequences , and I will have to live with what I have said .
Disneyland will go home and sleep quietly .
I want to go head to head and want my owners working to see me strive to give me everything that's best .
Since they begin to believe that this is not the case , I must give up the living profession .
At that point I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification .
Earlier , Moody threw the bomb in an interview given for racing.com in which he said integrity department tried to spy graphies .
Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey , Dillon le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were queuing in a room alongside a guy - whose name I'll tell if I'm asked - and offered to hire him to graphene to provide information about work there , Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he sees me as a cheat .
If so , then he should give all his resignation because they were incompetent in a bid to catch me .
Robert Roulston , former RVL president David Moodie , current chairman of RVL and Bernard Saundry , RVL's current CEO of CEO , knew at the time and they know today too .
Should I think it's something personal ?
Is it necessary that the RVL start having the backbone and can fire outsiders liable for what happens in industry ?
Do I have a bad influence on industry ?
So bad is my influence on industry ?
Maybe that's how others see it .
Maybe I have to take my licence and turn aside and I have no doubts that statements I do now might prompt him to think about this variant .
But I arrived at the point where I no longer care and that's what saddens me .
It saddens me very loud .
I'll put pressure on and make him make a decision .
My family supports me and they can walk away .
His frustration's frustration grew with the lengthy inquiry into testing at the little else where Lidari had been involved and the removal prompted him to assert that he might get his licence on the table .
Moody , whose name is most commonly associated with training undefeated Australian champions Black Caviar , labelled the treatment rule on race day as ridiculous after applying to horses'feet a pupil with namesol or argas , breaking the rules .
It tramples on flights .
I have to take my full responsibility for that , he says .
One of my employees put them out of their mistake nameless on leg .
It might have happened last night .
It might have happened yesterday , which happened .
It happened on race day .
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on race day consisting of the application of puppies , for which stewards have opened an investigation .
It's a joke .
People making these rules know nothing about horses .
We all understand that rules are needed , but too far has gone on , Moody said .

If the fundraiser champions decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount , defender Paul Papp decked a football school .
Paul Papp Academy will operate in the city of Nevada , with local pubs waiting for a selection first .
I'm extremely happy that we have reached this stage , to give the kick off to the Football Academy bearing me my name .
To me , it's extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without having any material worry about training .
They have to have one care : That's how best football can play .

This wants to make the Football Academy'Paul Papp'.

Everything wants governance .
PSD acting President Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that all the party wants to remain in government and , if the prime minister wants to , the PSD Congress will formalise his decision .
I understand that Mr Ponta expects this decision from the PSD Congress , everyone wants government , all the party .
If we want to formalise through a congressional ruling , we will do this too .
There will be no excitement about that .
There have been no elements , voices in the party , party views that give someone uncertainty of governance or give someone the impression that someone in the party doesn't want the PSD to remain in government , in the current government , with the incumbent prime minister , Dragnea said at the end of the PSD National Permanent Office meeting .
PSD announced when congress will make - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Tuesday it was important that , at the PSD Congress , beyond leadership election , it will send out a clear message if the government wants to continue with or if the party decides to move into opposition .
Dragnea : I will announce on Monday whether I will run for a post at Congress
Liviu Dragnea , meanwhile , will announce next Monday whether he will run for leadership in the upcoming Congress next Monday .
I shall weigh up , on Monday , after the Executive Committee , if it determines congress again .
I will announce whether I will run for a position in party leadership , Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD National Permanent Office .
Intrigued if hesitation about announcing his candidacy relates to his dossier , Dragnea said he did not have the problem .
I have no problem you refer to , but I find it fair and honest to all my party colleagues to announce me or not to submit a candidacy when formally setting up Congress .
It's the only motivation , Dragnea said .
The vast majority of social democratic branches proposed extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11th , and the exact date for Congress will be decided on Monday by the party's Executive Committee .

Thousands crossed to put a candle
Thousands passed on the coffin with Corneliu Vadim Tudor's body of guilt , so much world unheard of at the Saint George Church than to ressing his laceration to the Great St. Nicholas rampage , parish Emil Caramizaru said Wednesday .
Hundreds of people of all ages wait in a row , stretching from entering church to lounge streets to pass on puppy puppy coffin of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's body .
People wait about an hour to reach St George's Church , where groups every 40 people enter .
About 300 people per hour passed on Wednesday on the coffin of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's body painted body .
Thousands of people in Bucharest , but also in Cluj , Baia Mare , Iasi , Constanta and Craiova came , starting Tuesday , paying tribute to Corneliu Vadim Tudor , so much world we only had tribute to the 300 year church salute and the Hramatta Great St. Nicolae .
Corneliu Vadim Tudor was at a 300 year conversion of the church and sat alongside the members of the Holy Synod , by Preffin Daniel and representatives of the five patriarchy who participated in resceration , said Capital of Capital priest Emil Caramizaru .
According to him , people came with flowers and candles in his hand , buzzing and waiting in line , as on a day of great religious celebration .
It is extraordinary behaviour of these people , they worship , with dignity , children , old people , people in carje , as if it were a great religious holiday .

What about coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is in front of crucial decision on his career , with she having to choose whether to continue or not to work together with coach Darren Cahill .
They worked this year under the Adidas and Development programme , with the Australian technician alongside Romania only at key tournaments .
Simona only had words of praise for Cahill , who seems the only coach to have managed to impose himself on the culinary whim .
But Adidas's schedule will wrap up later this year , but Halep must decide whether to give them a consistent contract to Cahill or whether he will drop collaboration .
We don't yet know exactly what will happen .
We're talking and seeing .
After Singapore I can be able to give an answer , Simona testified at a news conference .
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in current tennis , calling for a contract of about a million dollars a year .
Moreover , Australians are also sporting commentator , a profession he would not want to give up today .
The last race at which Simona and Cahill will work together is the Campions Tournament , in Singapore .
It was not normal , I was not respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke down by Romania's national team last fall .
The former manager testified he did not understand FRF Chairman Razvan Burleanu after he took Mircea Newcastle's seat , and thus made the decision to leave national .
Finally , he proposed to the Federation chief to substantially increase his salary to stay , but refused .
At the time I'm not sorry we have gone from national cricket .
Then I feel sorry , we leave a work in the back .
The ASA then felt like it was good for me and I think it was good for me .
What happens to me when I was selecting er , it was not normal , I was not respected , do not respect my work .
I worked well with the pre Federation of Federation , but when Burleanu came to Federation came up with a predesigned idea , he didn't know me , find different views from the press about me .
It hasn't changed me because it was very hard at that point , with the results we had , plus that it was the financial situation in the middle .
I continued work , everything went very well and probably changed his ideas too .
But I wanted to leave .
If I really want to stay , I then proposed them an increase in contract .
We have around 400 and something thousands of euros per year , I was going to have around EUR 600 thousand .
I didn't talk to Burleanu , but with his right hand .
It agreed , but only if we finish first in the group , Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport .
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's national in autumn last year , although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 draft .
Tehzi accepted the proposal to coach in Saudi Arabia , he immediately takes over Al Ittihad .
Armored and water cannon on the border
Calculations said the votes existed .
But they didn't want to go ahead .
Because it is a sensitive issue , rejection reactions even appeared in Germany itself against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and did not want in many countries to appear that an EU type reaction sends us migrants per head .
They have therefore postponed , but the problem remains because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and we are likely to see great changes there in the coming period .
So mandatory quotas were not really discarded but the subject was only left to racially ill ?
Yes , on the other hand , there is talk of greater involvement by Frontex in managing external borders , which means changing from individual responsibility for members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies .
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's de facto border with Turkey , and this wave of migrants has given limits to the old Schengen system .
Perhaps Dublin will be dropped , according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they enter the first time , because it is unsustainable .
If Greece cashing in , you cannot endlessly say that it is Greece's job .
The problem is common .
Precisely because the problem is common , is it possible to solve it without a precise , perhaps binding mechanism for sharing the effort received ?
Nobody knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work , if binding quotas will be reached .
Because it remains a problem : What do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal , but in Sweden or Germany ?
I do not believe that European countries will turn up to take migrants above : You bump into our X or country Y.
It is likely to reach unique filtering centres , in Greece or Turkey , where asylum applications can be applied .
Solutions like this are working on .
But the problem has no simple solution .
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants , they are countries without any experience , as Romania , where the migrant problem will increase xenophobic power .
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey , in Lebanon , in Jordan , in Jordan , who sit in precarious camps and have barely started leaving for Europe .
One estimate says only 10 % went on , winter is heavy on the Mediterranean , but we expect a perhaps even greater wave next year .
What do we do with people ?
Pronoshope is that we'll get used to this problem , we're not going to look so catastrophic in media terms .
Vanishing countries with less or higher experience .
Does it seem to me that there is any place where the integration of large groups from a European extrapolation culture really managed ?
I look at magrease bians in France , Turks in Germany , they're increasingly adept .
I wouldn't go towards radical statements .
Sure , their integration is harder than in case of other waves of Migration , but that does not mean they do not integrate at all .
It remained an unintegrated side which creates major social problems in France , Germany , in Britain .
But pure means will not work .
Let us create Europe's stronghold of wishful thinking .
We must humiliate ourselves to the integration mechanisms in European societies .
Here were mistakes .
We have to be more pretentious .
It is a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania .
Mr Gatu ran civilised with a project , people gave their consent into principle but quickly made it clear that he would never build the hall .
I , too , had discussions with IOF , we told them we want , that we want , that we are able to organise and they said they agreed and invite them to first match in the new Bucharest hall and afterwards we talk concrete .
So we have all openness , and at IOF and NHF , but we don't have the infrastructure , the FRH official explained .
The former big handball player avoided assessing the chances of female teams CMS Bucharest and Greater Manchester United's Hockey Baia Mare to get to Final Four : I have asked all coaches to be booked in pronouns , that if they're not back against them .
Good road to World Cup
Romanian Prayer kicks off September 23rd , against France
National rugby team captain Mihai Macovei told a press conference Tuesday that all Romania's players are ready for England's World Cup matches where they hope to get two wins : We're ready .
Both my colleagues and colleagues are with engines to maximum turtle .
We trained to give the best yield on the four games .
Everyone will have great expectations , because our goal is to win in two games against Canada and Italy in two games .
All groups are heavy and ours is the same .
Take it slightly , the first time with France and then we will see .
Surely if we win with Canada , if we win with Canada , the match with Italy will be our final .
I cannot describe in words the joy of participation in the World Cup , it is the culmination of so many years of work .
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the family of Rugby and come up with nice results at home .
We want to be proud of that some players , a small family like Rugby's e Rugby in Romania , proudly represent the tricolour , Macovei said .
Romania's national team manager Lynn Champion , who was at first experience as a World Cup coach , hopes to make Romanians proud of selected rugby : It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup .
I'm sure players are ready to take part in the tournament .
It is an extraordinary experience for me .
It is very important for me that every game makes Romanians proud of the national team .
Romanian Rugby Federation president Haralambie Mathas has confidence that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years .
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team .
I wish their athletes success , and I am convinced that we will be at the hearts of the event .
These boys started playing in Romania's teams from 18 19 years , so there is cohesion , it's a gang of friends , who have set their sights on achieving a dream , Jadas said .
At rugby World Cup in England , Romania will perform in Group D , having their next matches scheduled : France , on 23 September in London ; with Ireland on September 27th in London ; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester ; Italy on 11 October at Exeter .

Patania a tourist
A family of Cluj tourists came to Iowa to visit him , but the trip ended with bitter promise .
After my experience , neither my wife nor my wife want to cook in your town anymore .
Without wanting , they have struck out with erroneous information from leaflets , unseeming controller of RAPT controllers and , bonus , fine as so called law .
Salisbury arrived in Iowa days ago , cashing in at a Centre hotel hotel and called for tourist leaflets .
They also got a trick in which RATP paths were crossed .
Armed with these maps , husbands visited the Ivenue .
But , two days ago , sitting in Copou , they wanted to get to Palas Mall .
Because it wasn't tongues with tickets to the station near Copou Park , they relied on printed information on the catcher : That they can take a ticket through SMS .
&apos;i didn't tell anyone that service no longer exists .
Confident in pliance , they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS following instructions from pliance .
Unfortunately for them , he has made his appearance a controllers team RATP .
They said there was no longer the 2 year service and that he had announced in the media that he had cancelled .
Me DE where SA know what's written in local media , I coming up with an evening before visiting the city ?
I spoke to controllers , explained their situation , they said they didn't care , it's not their job .
The attitude was very defiant .
They said everything they can do is deie a single fine instead of 2 ( ml and wife ) .
I paid , I didn't want to spoil my day visiting the gendarmerie and blaming there ! Ovidiu explains .
In conclusion , the family was fined due to erroneous information from leaflets and controllers who applied the law to blood .
It's not fair , and we have made a reference to RATP Iowa to recover my money .
It's not money , I'm not being blown up by many , but the idea is that I felt wrong .
Guessed for rapists in Vaslui .
They had accident and remained in cardiac arrest
The trial of seven rapists from the Cowboys moved to Iowa Magistrates Court yesterday .
Parramatta witnesses judged the first trial term in a non public session where the seven young men accused of mocking an 18 year old girl asked for freedom .
Prior to the actual start of the courtroom , one of the outstanding judges who had been assigned the file , Viorel Munteanu , formulated a request for abstention , what admitted by his court colleagues .
The magistrate activated this year to the Vaslui Tribunal until summer this year , where he was president of station On Treasurer , with him who , on 9 April , admitted a dispute filed by four of the defendants , with their placement under house arrest .
Currently , the file is judged by a complete indictment involving magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Newcastle .
Earlier , on file he formulated an abstention and judge Dan Year Champion , on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship of segregation with one of rapists lawyers .
The two judges decided that rapists from Vaslui remain in preventive custody .
Ti Champion will remain jailed for at least another 30 days when Jude Treasurer will rediscuss the possibility of putting them at large .
A trial deadline will run at Iowa Magistrates Court on October 6 .
Before reaching Iowa Court of Iowa Court of ISIS Appeal , the duba with whom rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the Packers neighborhood , car entering ISIS on his belt .
Autoslitara Iveco with whom the seven rapists were transported struck a Volks Commodore car floating from the street playing and the driver tried to cook on the left .
Duba roam out of an end Packers .
The car went viral in Iowa here because Penitars Administration employees preferred the route from Vaslui to Iowa on tough graphene , then on their belt catching socks .
They then cut the road down several kilometres .
Immediately after the impact , escort detainees called for another shipment , to take over inmates .
Shortly after the accident came a car from Pennington maximum safety ISIS safety , who took the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal .
Following the accident , none of the detainees were injured .
To transfer them to the other duba , guards surrounded the rear side of the Masi Sharks and the detains went out in speed , two by two .
The incident has not been reported to Pollard because drivers of the do UA motor vehicles have understood amiable in terms of damage to be paid for , chief Commissioner Madalin Taranu said from IPJ .
Big migrations
Romania is neither nor will it be prepared for what will follow .
What about Europe ?
I say from the beginning , clear and clear : The 7 000 refugees they should and must naturalise Romania represent , in itself , an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project .
For Romania , even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest , amounting to around 1 500 discards , far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months .
Surely , if those migrants really accept to settle in our cities , the chances of rapid integration into Romanian society are extraordinarily small .
I am sure they will be the first to lose their patience .
Parried by mobsters and paralysed by a vengeance class , the Romanian state proves bogged down in all areas .
Unable to integrate Gypsies is just a banal example .
In addition to that , governments of any colour have not been able to absorb European funds , make roads , kindergartens or modern schools , ensure decent medical care , raise the mess along the street , create jobs paid honourable or retain their own young generation home .
Why would refugees settle into another country in which they are running away ?
But what makes a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with whom such a crisis is being treated .
We first face fateful bellicia of strong EU states , which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries .
Then comes the friction hypocrisy of Romanians who , although millions of relatives scattered across the world , do not yet accept each other - another religion , other religion , another blood .
Fear not stealing her careva .
After all , there is also hypocrisy of many migrants , who , although they cite only the horrors of war as reason for their departure , do not accept any other destination of exodus than Germany or Nordic countries .
However , not all refugees are Syrians and there is no war in Pakistan .
Likewise , the simplistic way in which the crisis is considered cannot be mocked .
The causes must be eliminated , I support some and , strictly speaking on the card of political correctness , seek peace and investment for migrants'origin countries .
But in Romania there is peace and even falls , from time to time , from time to time , something foreign capital into the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year .
Why do they leave ?
In this crisis , the European Union has been revealed to us as an anatomy , divisive and outdated construct of the situation .
Decrying was crying out that Romania is unable to invent itself a draft country , but IATA that neither the EU possesses any future plan .
And improvisation and threats help nothing .
What more is the EU using , then , if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be questioned because of the waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese ?
At some point , the war in Syria will end .
Not the migrant crisis , however .
Over the coming decades , overpopulation , poverty , climate change , depletion of resources etc. will push millions of desperate migrants out of Asia and especially from Africa to a better life .
Romania , too , is neither nor will Romania be prepared for what will follow .

Two frenzy in Tomai swallowed salmon .
They were taken to hospital

Exclusive : A meeting that Iti breaks heart .
At 20 he got a brave gift : Biological parents
Lost in hospital in unclear conditions , in the non hatred of the 90s , when he had only two months of life , little , bolted and helpless , and then passed by a wealthy Italy family , in the same period where adoption was vaguely regulated , a young retired young woman , now a blonde and beautiful girl , reunited the day before in Iowa girl with biological parents in a county village , nearly two decades ago where no one knew anything of the others .
Crine will be going to be 20 years old and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to give her beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift : A visit to Romania in Iowa to know her unclear past .
The Iowa newspaper , which assisted the family of Origin efforts after several highly vague hints , witnessed those meetings practically Iti rout the heart .
The coverage of reporters , emotions of moms , statements of those involved , their reactions are downright slow and awesome .
The story of Crucible begins 20 years ago in Corey Prayer , on when he had only two months old .
Then , due to a health problem , the girl had to be internalized in hospital , to the city .
At home they started having misunderstandings between parents and the mother had to parish the residence .
He decided to keep up , and guys to send me from home .
He stopped the girl , and since then I didn't know anything anymore .
When I learned that he was in hospital , it was too late , remembers Jonny Alina , the girl's biological mother .
Crina was internalized along with her grandmother at Pascani City Hospital and also then the girl's father , Costic Balcan , left work in Alexandria's Teleorman County .
Their whim had to break up definitively .
N't Have Crine at Hospital
After internment , Crine's father had gone to work in another locality , and returned after six months .
Meanwhile , the girl was transferred to Iowa hospital , and dad , when she returned , didn't find it anymore .
I think he had spent nearly nine months since the girl was in hospital .
I'd thought it was abandoned , he recounts a family granddaughter .
Due to financial problems , the grandmother couldn't come up with Crine in Iowa , and the girl stayed in the care of doctors .
Because no one more interested in the child's fate all this time , she was taken by the Directorate General for Social Assistance and Child Protection ISIS , which then gave her to care for the Plastic Plastic Surgery Centre .
There were years when abandonment and adoption were less regulated than today in Romania .
At the Bucium Center was found by the Lib Demore and his wife , a couple from Palermo what they wanted to have their child but did not succeed .
They fell in love with blonde Crine , and after something time she had to move definitively with them to Italy .
The little had already served nearly two years , how long adoption formalities took place .
When I saw Crina , I felt like e was face .
As if my wife had given her life , says smiling Commodore , the adoptive father , while catching up in his palm of the thick hand of the face .
In the country , Crine's parents , Alina and Costica , continued separately searches , each on where he could .
Dad asked authorities in Prairie but received no response where his child might be .
Police then told them she was likely to be handcuffed , but in Iowa parents learned what really happened to them .
When I looked at it here , they told me at the Court that they were leaving Italy , in Palermo .
And conditions to look for her didn't have .
We asked God to be fine .
I thought about her in all the years that passed away , but there were no possibilities like to humiliate , find it .
It's hard , tells us tears in the eyes of Crouch's biological mother .
But even if the years passed , Prairie's parents weren't forgotten .
In Italy , Commodore and wife explained to her daughter where it comes and that her past connects Romania .
I was small when I learned .
I think we had five or six years old .
I reacted as a copped , I was curious .
I wanted to know my parents from Romania , confess to Crina .
And her dream was going to become reality .
In March this year , Chief Commissioner Romica Ierner , director of the Regional Centre for Disease Prevention , Review and Antidrug Adventures ISIS , was contacted by an acquaintance of Italy , who explained to Italy's desire for Commodore to find Crash's biological family .
And the search just started from a name .
After the request we had from our partners in Italy , we started the first steps .
Primisem only a name , Balcan Costic , then locality , Prairie .
Shortly I had a work with City Hall there , and I was able to ask whether there was by locality the name received .
Then they gave me a few indications , only that the person found was not even desirable .
It took until nearly a month ago until we find the biological father of the face , explains Chief Commissioner Romica Ierner .
In all , more than three months have taken authorities to track down Cosby and Alina , especially as each resident in another locality .
We started moving somewhere in March , and in June and July we completed identification of biological teams and discussions .
Then we set out that there was a first meeting in September , added Romica Ierner .
In the weekend that passed , Alina and Costic saw their first face lost to the hallway of Iowa hospital 20 years ago .
Dad , excited , barely can contain his tears , and the hands of her treadmill relentlessly .
It barely changes some words with those around .
A week before the meeting , neither could they sleep .
He was all excited , hate .
Like to see your child after so many years , it's something , says one granddaughter , cast and she with Costic from Prairie .
Meet Crunch With Her Mother and brother
In talk to her face , who is expected to study at an well rated university in Italy , Costic Balcan told him , among other things , that if he once wants to return to him , in the village , come quiet : II can give something sheep , goats , like to find a boy from the village and clinch a household .
Mother e and she moved , crying , and believe hard that something like that can happen to them .
I'm very embarrassed .
I didn't think anything like that could happen .
I've seen so cases on TV , I've ever thought about these years , I hoped , but I didn't think I could be , too .
They're very big emotions .
If they could forgive me .
I hope we will visit us in the future .
I hope we can keep a connection , tells us with great tears at Jacobi Alina , Crine's mother while keeping tight in her hand a serviceable .
He still hides his tears , thankfully , because soon he will see herself facing them after so much bitter weather .
By contrast , Crina , who will turn across just days later this month , 20 , is trying to calm himself like an emotional kid .
He doesn't know what to expect but sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents .
He thinks they're young , but now before the meeting tries to collect their thoughts , because he has a lot to say but nothing to reproach the village .
My parents are two mothers and two fathers .
But my parents are up to the end of those who grew up me up .
It's going to be a nice encounter , wonderful experience .
I hope I have a nice memory with them because now there's so much to say , he told us Crina .
First Family Meeting in Iowa
In Uncle Square , under the skies of early autumn skies , the family in Prairite again reunite their destiny with their face in Palermo .
Crina now has 20 , finishing high school , after the Italian school model , but can begin a new chapter with Alina and Cosby , her biological parents .
There are no borders or countries apart from them , but only a barrier : Language .
Fish which , with the help of an interpreter , a local owner at the centre of Isis , have easily passed away .
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first event of this kind , and that , in future , if there is an opportunity , they will do it .
It's the first such event of this kind held , like an emotional caravan , and I am happy to be successful .
We at the Centre have different activities , and often we associate ourselves as an institution which only deals with consumer addicts .
But we're trying to bring society back to society something good back .
If I'd be asked for such a venue , I'll do it with great pride , says smiling Romica Ierner , director of the Regional Center for Disease Prevention , Review and ISIS Antidrug Adventures .
Behind him , Balcan's family , with Crina in the middle , walk away from telling them .
They're understandable : They have much to tell each other .
Armistiu with arms on his leg yesterday at PSD .
Everyone pulls its soul
Camps in the PSD grand branch branch sealed a gun truce on foot .
After successive rounds of talks Friday through Sunday , the first being and the most tense , PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities .
Sprinkled by party Executive Chairman Liviu Dragnea to present a united position , extraordinary Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party posts .
Far from over , domestic war within the party appears to have taken only pause to allow combatants to draw their soul .
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum .
It has launched a very simple and very present message in now : Try to find a solution not to jeopardise the party .
We have elections in the party on 3 October .
All functions will be made available to those who want them .
Until then , we remain in the existing structure , Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica said .
The two days of weekend talks only resulted in the conclusion that nothing was defined .
Fierce competition is expected in October elections for president of the PSD branch of the PSD .
On the short list of potential candidates for the main post in the party's frontbencher is state secretary Maricel Popa , Senator Florin Constantinescu , Senator Sorin Lazar , County councillor Vasile Catea and acting president of the County Council , Victorel Lupu .
The mayor of como Schitu Lead Mihai Mihalache could add to them .
One option considered is also the candidacy of PSD mayoral advisers Cristian Stanaou if Lupu no longer enroll in the race , with party sources saying he was not interested in office .
The only name not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader George Nichita .
The list of candidates is open .
According to status , including on elections day applications can be submitted , applications can be submitted , and would not Mira Mira if it happened .
Importantly , we remain united , and we will remain until 3 October , when we have a new Executive Office , a new county Permanent Office and all new leadership structures , said Catea .
Until the organisation of the internal elections is held , leadership of the PSD county branch will be secured by Victory's Victorian Lupu , a close to Nichita and Stananov .
Lupu , however , are on leave until September 29th , preparing elections practically expected to be secured by the branch's chief executive , County councillor Mikhail Popescu , in cold relations with Nichita camp .
Contacted phone , Cristian Stananov praised the talks in recent days that leading to partial consensus .
There's broad availability to maintain balance and unity in the party .
Partly consensus has been reached for supporting a unitary team to deal with county cricket .
But on the other hand there are several variants concerning intentions regarding candidacy for the PSD Iasi presidency , with the list remaining open , Stanchev commented .
Nottingham judge refused Rangers file on grounds of solitary confinement
The seven young Rangers County men convicted of rape arrive today at Iowa Magistrates Court .
Vasluiinians sentenced to penalties between five years and eight months and eight months and four years and four months will present their arguments on putting them at large today , after the substantive court , Judge Jon Stewart , established their imprisonment immediately after sentencing .
The file was recorded at the Court of Appeal late last week , with magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstention , admitted by his colleagues .
Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants'lawyers , lawyer Bogdan Luca , is competing with her daughter , lawyer Dana Anton .
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada , the one who received his greatest punishment on this file .
How motivated judges ruling
Late last week , the magistrate from Judges , who sentenced seven youths , motivated the ruling .
In motivating judge talks about the defiant reaction of defendants but also those who supported them , saying such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among public opinion .
The court finds that after the time being conducted under the preventive measure of judicial control , restrictive measure of freedom but not grounds of freedom , under the impact of the attitude of defendants , families and local supporters , it has been felt at local and national community levels a strong sense of indignation that persons accused of serious facts are judged under a less restrictive measure , the motivational speaker of the Vaslui Chamber said .
Magistrates also dismantled and the main defence of seven defendants during the trial invoked that the girl they raped was not church door .
The sublime court that it lacks relevance to the moral quality of the injured person , something the defendants wanted to emphasise through appearances they formulated , since one person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext , the motivation said .
Corbyn , Brexit &amp; Future of Europe
For economic and demographic causes , prosperity enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue in the coming years .
Until Saturday probably little world knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is .
Even today , having become the new leader of Britain's Labour Party , many wonder to what extent it can affect our election of a politician who , after all , is not in a position of decision .
Jeremy Corbyn is Labour's most radical leftist leader after war .
Marxist declared , anti monarchy ( asked at some point Tony Blair , then the prime minister , to pull the royal family out of Buckingam Palace ) , a rude anti American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin ( who was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel Russia Today ) , and Hezbollah terrorist movements and Hamas , he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and emerge from NATO and the EU .
For Corbyn , who considered killing Osama bin Laden at the time , a real tragedy , ISIS is almost preferable to the United States .
After the model of all populist demagogues , Corbyn has , of course , miraculous anti austerity solutions .
Things like the kind of guys he was saying and promised and Tsipras to Greece until when he shook his chest with the real world and economic legalization .
The economic programme of the new Labour leader provides , among other things , renationalisation massive renationalisation and printing money as a solution to financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits .
Sure , some may wonder why the solution with printing money is not unanimous on the globe , then we would have a global overall prosperity then , but who would prevent such details from occurring again .
Sure , we can charge the blood on bankers , you become a kind of enemy service enemy of the Left , but as far as has seen so many times in the past , not only in former communist states or Ecuador or Venezuela or Venezuela , but also in France at the beginning of Mitterrand and Hollande's mandates .
Extra sums are quickly swallowed up by generous , contactless promises made by populist demagogues .
As Margaret Thatcher pointed out ,'the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others ends'.
Few give real chances to Jeremy Corbyn to ever get the prime minister .
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader Michael Foot , who anyway wasn't as extreme as belief as the party's premiership leader , failed miserably in the election .
And then there's still a working class in Britain in the classic sense of word , relatively consistent and structured .
And unions were most influential than now .
Under the new industrial landscape where services are dominant throughout the workforce , and expanded automakers have made industry massive needed in industry massively needed , Corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal .
But , even out of opposition , he can influence important developments that can directly affect us .
In its last Financial Times he believes Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit , namely Britain's exit from the EU .
The new Labour leader has been a consistent opponent of country membership in the Union .
In the eyes of the radical Left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor .
When combative this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right , with anti immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis rocking out EU foundations , you end up getting explosive blend .
And not just for Britain .
But if Britons decide in the wake of the referendum , which would be held by 2017 , leaving the Union loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and deep flak created inside it by the euro crisis and now that is why refugees , between North and South , between East and West , leave room for scenarios of most worrying .
All the more so as for a whole range of Member States , London was a counterpoint to the Franco German axis ( in which Berlin anyway becomes increasingly the dominant actor ) .
True , British business , City City , are powerful lawyers for remaining the country into the EU .
Europe today is no longer the one in the past .
There's a lot of resentment , growing in intensity just these weeks .
The problem is that Brussels , we even had a specimen recently in Jean Cluj's speech by Junker , increasingly tends to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of Member States consulting with only a few European powers , mainly Germany .
And that's when electoral support for anti system formations , anti immigration formations that are at the same time , too Eurosceptic , is increasing dramatically across the continent .
In other words , the emotional climate with negative cargo has reached higher rates than ever before .
Hence the conclusion the Financial Times draw when assessing Brexit's chances .
The pro EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves from national interest .
If voters take their decision , then Britain will remain in the EU .
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of excitement in current politics .
However , Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments .
Especially if , as expected , we will see greater integration of the euro area , pushing most states in the region and the periphery of interest and part of Europe's decision process .
Corbyn , Tsipras and Syriza in Greece , Podemos in Spain , even Bernie Sanders in the United States are feeding their populist rhetoric from frustrations accrued in oocious societies .
For economic and demographic causes , the prosperity enjoyed over the last decades , generous social benefits cannot continue in the coming years .
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis , the euro zone - immigration , both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken account of the integrationist political ambitions , not the capacity and readiness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges , turbulence on the continent , internal tensions within the continent will increase in intensity and potentially affect Romania's situation major .
It is hard to exclude anything from the point of view of possible scenarios .
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to face such complicated situations .
Constantin Brancusi , the tarmac .
Rockefeller : How can I help you ?
Brancusi : Takes and mature the workshop !
The great sculptor had a great dream : To be someone , to get famous , to hear about him worldwide .
But behind the recount , or hiding anything almost forgotten today , when millions of success stories are delivered , recipes for success in life , are delivered to us .
That something also has a name .
Call truddle .
What to write about Constantin Brancusi ?
What is more to say , actually ?
His figure appeared on banknotes .
And soon a known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in a publicity stunt .
Brancusi produces and delivering money nearly 60 years since he is no longer among us .
There are hundreds of streets and boulders in Romania wearing their name .
Incidentally , even the author of this text lives on one of these streets .
And when he emerges apart from oops to , he hears the following instructions : We go to the park , Brancusi .
The country is crowded with its statuettes .
There are few Romanian personalities whose works will be known by so much world , from children , to the elderly .
Brancusi's ability to infiltrate Brancusi is a huge one .
Neither Communists managed to excel Romania from Romania's memory and culture .
Its quotations crowded the internet today , receiving hundreds of thousands of SMEs and SMEs .
And then again , again , what would he be to say , actually writing about this guy ?
Viewed from the bunch of books and articles trying to recreate their destiny , Brancusi's life looks almost fantastic , totally unlikely .
You know , they're those people telling you that if you didn't have luck to bury them in any big city and in a family how much you're getting richer , your chances of success alive are almost nil .
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample .
And maybe here would be a key .
Perhaps here should be the beginning of the text here to begin .
With a ruling , however frivolous they are .
Uses success stories creepy , which will be delivered daily in newspapers and TV shows .
Watch carefully this man's figure .
Vintable to know how to succeed in life like , how , today , by him he heard a whole globe ?
It is simple .
He worked all life to be someone .
That's what he did .
Constantin Brancusi is born on 19 February 1876 , in Hobita , a small village in Common Pestisani , Gorj County , at the foot of the Carpathian basin .
It is Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi's fifth child .
Although he came from a family of affluent peasants Brancusi takes a modest life , but one that he had to reap his repertoire will guide his late feminism vision .
Recalling childhood and places where she grew up , the artist had to confess , in a meeting with Petre Tutea , from 1933 , from 1933 : On then life was nice and harmonious .
For millennia , people bumped , happy , a patriarchal life .
Everything was going quiet from one season to another .
And do you know why things have changed ?
The civilization of the great city has come to us .
Brancusi's Copilaria was but far from an idyllic one .
One of the moments spent in these years of life is highly indicative of the combination of purity and violence that characterised his future sculptor years in his native town .
The moment is reproduced in the work of Brancusi . A biography , written by Alexander Bujar .
In 1879 , Constantin Brancusi had 3 years old .
In the autumn of that year , when the tuica was made every year , tracing those who sample the liquidation as seeing if the process unfolds as required , Brancusi catches a moment of general unconscious .
Fill his cavities with tubes and drink on the nerves .
Falls in sleep almost instantly .
The first people only notice after a few minutes .
Mother enters panic , then in hysteria , believing that son died .
Towards the evening , when father Radu , returns from vines accompanied by lauts , he sees the desperate signs of those who eagerly await her breath .
The party immediately turns into jale .
Dad already thinks of Fenway .
Yet someone finds that e well has a phone on Baba Brandusa , the sheep's gift and serviceable serve .
Brandusa checks the baby's breath , then puts her under the nose of horse panned horse gathered from the edge .
Baby thug strong .
The world applauds .
As the boy e left sleeps further , joy party party continues with even more force .
The second day , father and son meet through orchards .
Radu Brancusi puts Constantin to collect some nude and bring them up .
Dad ashires his baby with her head down and , with his little boy nukes , beats him as to keep mind .
And while it feels garlic blows , breakfast Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective too , and that things around can appear overturned .
Especially the sun's standing , different from the well known one , makes him wonder , as they have to admit in old age , if not somehow astray participates in his disturbance .
Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father of what happened to him ?
Currently City don't work
An MP calls for politicians to remember those who voted for them .
Independent deputy Viorel Blhelp called on PSD and PNL to cease domestic infighting and refocus their agenda towards the electorate .
What we see now on our political scene is a great division and both .
I've seen nothing of the USL projects in 2012 to continue .
Neither motorway nor Regional Emergency Hospital only see how politicians dispute their possible sites according to real estate interests .
Let us leave a little bit aside politics , gather and talk .
At present , the city isn't working .
If Esti occupied with domestic war , you don't have any time for those who chose you , Blhelp said .
He appreciated that the current political class disappointed the graduate electorate , with a consequence expected to be a very low turnout in upcoming local elections , around 30 % figure , representing practically the faithful electorate of parties .
The deputy also believes voters will move towards mainstream parties as well , expressing reservations about new political initiatives such as the For Iowa party that will be launched today .
Local parties have very little chances and will only break up from the electorate of the right , not PSD .
Such parties rely on civic active people , who rule are right .
It's crumbling further right , which is not good for anyone , nor for the PSD , Blhelp said .
He made clear he was not interested in a bid at upcoming local elections , denying rumours of his intention to enroll in mayoral race .
I've also said I don't want to run for any local office .
I am thinking of whether to continue as an MEP and in his future mandate .
I tried to call for unity for Iowa and in discussions on the hallway , with other MPs , and I was accused of wanting to file a picture .
I don't want but we can't go on like that anymore .
If people have voted in us , it doesn't mean they're fools to vote if they see nothing , Blhelp said , who appreciated that the main reason voters no longer interested in politics is hypocrisy aloft .
A colleague from Jazasi said he didn't get his money and have to go bus .
Let us not be hypocritical .
There is no money .
Sometimes I feel ashamed to raise money from casiery .
At the end of my term of office I will report everything we have spent , outside the salaries of employees from cabinet employees and its maintenance .
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei in one month , with all transport disconnect , accommodations and others .
Telling an MP they're not getting his money e clean hypocrisy , Blhelp concluded .
